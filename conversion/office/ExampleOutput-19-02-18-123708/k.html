But despite elaborate memorialisations of the Holocaust, present-day responses to asylum seekers, would suggest that self-reflexive memories are the exception to the rule in the realpolitik of international affairs. It is for this reason that revisiting the configurations of relations between past, present and future are important. First, they unsettle ideas of the present as somehow novel and unprecedented, therefore justifying ‘special’ measures that subjectify asylum seekers and refugees as dangerous, racialised others while installing practices which have punitive effects not only for the stranger, but also for sections of the citizenry. Second, the diverse connections between different times and spaces alerts us to the relations between forced migrations and an uneven global political economy in which </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">wars, conflicts and ecological and societal crises are entangled with geopolitical and biopolitical failures</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> (Castles, 2003; Klein, 2016; Zolberg, Suhrke, &amp; Aguayo, 1989).

Sidhu Australian is widely celebrated as an early and enthusiastic supporter of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, an arguably inflated claim that is repeatedly recycled by politicians as proof of the country’s humanitarian credentials. The limitations of the Convention have been sketched in some detail elsewhere (see Lui, 2004; Peters &amp; Besley, 2015) and are revisited briefly only to provide a useful background for this article. The Convention’s </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">origins in the context of the bipolar world of the cold war, </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">enacts a binary logic between deserving victims of political oppression and undeserving economic migrants</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> although a clear distinction between both categories has shown to be highly problematic</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. Second, it is notable that the Convention fails to support those countries receiving the largest numbers of asylum seekers. In the absence of any blueprint for burden sharing, a collective and coherent effort for managing flows of refugees is stymied. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Critics</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> of the Convention also </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">point to the inflated costs of assembling border regimes and processing asylum applications by Western countries compared to the support they give to the U</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">nited </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">N</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">ational Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In 2014/2015, Australia spent close to A$1 billion on running detention centres to incarcerate asylum seekers. This was nearly one third of the UNHCR’s annual global budget of $3.72 billion that provides assistance to some 46 million refugees and displaced people (Australian Broadcasting Commission [ABC], 2015). In her critique of the Convention and international protection for refugees, Robyn </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">Lui describes the refugee regime </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">as ‘…a form of geopolitical humanitarianism that has as its “core business” the preservation of the value of the nation-state form and the institution of national citizenship’</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. Lui argues that </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">it is the broad social acceptance of the sovereignty and primacy of nation states which nourishes acceptance by citizens of border regimes to govern the inter-state movements of people</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Desperate and persecuted people thus come to be seen as threats to national security and social order</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. Writing on the Australian context, Hage (2016) and Jakobowicz (2004) locate the ‘phobia of the stranger’ to a colonial imaginary of unannounced arrivals, unauthorised seizures of land and violation of indigenous people. Much space has been devoted to analysing the mobilisation of these historical fears to justify the use of harsh and punitive measures towards boat arrivals of asylum seekers. The use of </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">rhetorical devices</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> to </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">manufacture pejorative and criminal forms of subjectivity for ‘bogus’ asylum seekers </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">have been the focus of several studies (Christie &amp; Sidhu, 2006; Pickering, 2001). At least three Australian election campaigns in the recent past have been framed by fears of a fragile national sovereignty. ‘Operation Sovereign Borders’ has seen the deployment of Australian defence forces in immigration management, a move criticised for </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">militarisation of a humanitarian matter and politicising the defence</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> forces.

Although proclaimed as a success, Operation Sovereign Borders has been embroiled in serious allegations involving ill treatment of asylum seekers and the payment of bribes to Indonesian officials and people smugglers to turn the boats of asylum seekers away from Australian waters (Amnesty International, 2015). The raft of legislative and policy activity called on to fortify its maritime borders has also raised questions about Australia’s capacity to meet its maritime obligations under the 1982 United Nationals Convention on the Law of the Sea, while deflection of asylum processing onto neighbouring Papua New Guinea and Nauru has re-established a colonial geopolitics in the Pacific (Rajaram, 2003). </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Throughout, a persistent political rationality has been in play to convince the citizenry of the need to sort out the ‘genuine’ and deserving asylum seekers from the undeserving</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. In 2012, the government assembled a three-member expert panel that recommended that maritime arrivals should not have advantages over authentic refugees who lodged their applications in countries of first asylum (see Houston, Aristotle, &amp; L’Estrange, 2012). More recently, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">politicians</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> both in Australia and overseas </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">have conscripted and re-assembled a humanitarian rationality to argue detention protected asylum seekers from dangerous journeys</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> undertaken at the hands of criminal syndicates of people smugglers. In 2014, a National Inquiry into Children in Detention, The Forgotten Children was carried out by the Australian Human Rights Commission to investigate the effects of detention on the health, well-being and development of children whose parents had sought asylum. In doing so, the Commission was fulfilling its statutory duty to monitor Australia’s compliance with international treaties that it is a signatory to such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Educational Philosophy and Theory 297 Political Rights (AHRC, 2015). The Inquiry found that </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">34% of detained children had severe mental health problems, compared to 2% in the community.

In this article, we make a different, but related, argument: that </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">the externalization of asylum represents a shift from the legal domain where international instruments to protect refugees are still very much intact to the political domain where migrant ﬂows are managed, preferably in regions of origin</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">.

The securitization of asylum continues as ﬁercely between the lines of policy as among them. TRACING EXTERNALIZATIONIn 1993, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Madame Sadako Ogata, introduced the concept of ‘preventive pro-tection’, thus marking a distinctive shift in the orientation of refugee policy that occurred in the early 1990s.12Preventive protection belongs to a language that emphasizes the ‘right to remain’ in one’s home country over the former dominant discourse of the ‘right to leave’. The ‘right to remain’ was endorsed by Ogata: Today displacement is as much a problem within borders as across them....the political and strategic value of granting asylum diminishes.. . . The cost of processing asylum applications has skyrocketed, while public acceptance of refugees has plummeted....At the heart of...a preventive solution-oriented strategy must be the clear recognition of the right of people to remain in safety in their homes....‘the right to remain’...the basic right of the individual not to be forced into exile....I am convinced that preventive activities can help to contain the dimensions of humancatastrophe by creating time and space for the political process. In the 1990s, preventive protection and the containment of human displacement proved to be a very dangerous policy, especially in Srebrenica in July 1995, when Dutch peacekeepers were unable to keep Serb militias at bay. Between 7,000 and 8,000 Muslim boys and men were murdered in this so-called ‘safe city’.13Preventive protec-tion also shifted protection from legal ground, namely the Refugee Convention, to political ground, whereby the UN Security Council named six safe cities inside Bosnia-Herzegovina, authorized peace-keepers to protect them, and in so doing ethnically cleansed the Bosnian countryside of endangered Muslim civilians. If these civilians had been allowed to ‘leak’ into nearby signatory states as refugees, the slaughter could have been averted. This anecdote illustrates that ‘protection in the region’ and the exclusion of asylum seekers from the territory of signatory states in the global North is not new. Fur-thermore, ‘preventive protection’ has returned under another guise: preventive protection of home through the neo-refoulement of asylum seekers to transit countries or regions of origin, from where they can ‘properly’ apply for asylum consideration. This architecture of enmity, framed as protection, has been con-structed policy by policy. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">The respatialization of asylum is a deliberate political project stoked by fear and buttressed by incredible funds and ‘aid’ in the name of ‘security’</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">.

SECURITY, FEAR AND THE UNINVITED MIGRANT Ian McEwan’s novel, Saturday, subtly represents the production of fear generated by attacks on the nation in a post-9/11 world. Pre-emptive security measures to minimize risk are proffered as the way forward in an unstable world: ‘Sleepless in the early hours, you make a nest out of your own fears – there must have been survival advantage in dreaming up bad outcomes and scheming to avoid them. This trick of dark imagining is one legacy of natural selection in a dangerousworld.’14 </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The threat of migrant invasion is underwritten by securitization, a governmentality based on mistrust and fear of the uninvited other</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">.15 </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">The mobilization of fear to securitize asylum serves a politically pow-erful resource for states that need legitimate grounds for extraordi-nary measures, </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">such as exclusion from their territories by potentially legitimate legal subjects, namely asylum seekers</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">.16Yet ‘</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Government practices of border control do not simply defend the “inside” from the threats “outside”, but continually produce our sense of the insid-ers and outsiders in the global political economy</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">’.17Societal fear is actively fueled by the reiteration of threats and creation of discursive distance between ‘us’ and ‘them’, producing a crisis in search of a response. Such crises create an opening for states to advance enforce-ment agendas.18In their responses to human smuggling by sea, for example, AlisonMountz shows how </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">states operate transnationally, working far beyond traditional territorial borders through airline carrier sanctions, off-shore screening of passengers by airline liaison ofﬁcers and visa restrictions</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> to exclude asylum seekers and other migrants.19Complementing this analysis, William Walters also argues that </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">security measures transcend the political borders of any single nation-state, and he introduces the concept of ‘domopolitics’</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> to suggest the central place of the home (domus) in geopolitical discourse:‘</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Domopolitics implies a reconﬁguring of the relations between citi-zenship, state, and territory.

Migrants occupy these spheres ‘outside’ national belonging. Matthew Sparke argues that the securitization of nationalism, evident in the discursive distance actively created between ‘us’ and ‘them’, is consistent with a state’s economic goals related to migra-tion: ‘By securitised nationalism I am referring to the cultural-political forces that lead to the imagining, surveilling and policing of the nation-state in especially exclusionary but economically discern-ing ways.’22Didier Bigo observes that </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">the ‘expansion of what security is taken to include effectively results in a convergence between the meaning of international and internal security</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">.’2</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000008"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000009"> </span></p><h3 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading3"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000003">1NC – Asylum: Labor Stability</span></h3><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000001"> </span></p><h4 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading4"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">Thinking through asylum politically is always preceded by questions of labor stability, political calculations are made to protect the economy first</span></h4><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">TIETZE 10 </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">[Tad Tietze, “What really lies behind refugee policy”, psychiatrist and labor specialist @ University of New South Wales, Dec. 28, 2010; http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-12-29/what_really_lies_behind_refugee_policy/42532]</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">The Christmas Island boat tragedy foregrounded debates that were already gaining in prominence and shrillness over the past year or so, disagreements over the ins and outs of</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> Australia’s </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">refugee policy</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">I’m sure every reader of The Drum will roll their eyes when they read the subject headings: The threat of invasion.

France For 30 years after WWII, undocumented migrants are welcomed and encouraged to make up for population losses in the war in the context of a booming economy. In 1966 the minister for social affairs declares, “Clandestine immigration in itself is not without benefit” - a good thing given 82 per cent of immigrants are informal, with most later “regularised” through access to permanent residency. Recession in the 1970s leads to cuts to migration, denial of residency rights, and by 2000 up to 90 per cent of refugee applicants are rejected. In recent months President Nicholas Sarkozy declares “war” against Roma travellers, </span><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/07/3004410.htm"><span class="pt-Hyperlink">threatening to strip them of citizenship and deport them</span></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. Germany Unlike France, “border control” is official policy after WWII, with “guestworkers” treated as temporary commodities to be “rotated” to prevent permanent settlement - but these rules are observed mainly in the breach. By the 1990s Germany has the largest population of irregular migrants of any EU nation. With the economic downturn in the 1970s, governments apply increasingly harsh measures in response to anti-immigrant sentiment from right-wing parties, but the needs of industry make mass deportations and true “rotation” economically unviable. Instead there are campaigns against “apparent” (non-genuine) asylum seekers, with no less than 18 changes to rules governing refugee status between 1983 and 1992. In 2010 the </span><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/multiculturalism-in-germany-has-failed-says-chancellor-20101017-16p7h.html"><span class="pt-Hyperlink">conservative prime minister</span></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> and even </span><a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/german-banker-thilo-sarrazin-defends-racism/story-e6frg6so-1225912524846"><span class="pt-Hyperlink">a prominent member</span></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> of the centre-left SPD publicly attack multiculturalism and Muslim immigration. United Kingdom Policy after WWII is initially defined by racial limits on who are “appropriate” migrants - many Jewish Holocaust survivors are denied entry. Demand for labour becomes so high that migration is opened up to former British colonies, with large movements from the Indian subcontinent. A 1962 law even allows illegal entrants who manage to avoid detection for 24 hours the right to stay. With the economic downturn of the 1970s, surveillance and checking of migrants increases but few actual deportations occur. Severe restrictions are placed on non-white Commonwealth immigrants by only allowing those with UK parentage. In the early 1990s a big increase in arrivals leads to new laws against “bogus” asylum seekers, with the opposition Labour Party joining in</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">the</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">attacks. The rate of refusal of refugee applications rises from 16 per cent in 1993 to 75 per cent in 1994. As recently as February, under the Labour government, </span><a href="http://www.legalfrontiers.ca/2010/06/the-securitization-of-immigration-and-refugee-law-in-the-united-kingdom/"><span class="pt-Hyperlink">the Home Office boasts</span></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> of making Britain “a more hostile place for illegal immigrants”. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">United States From the 1940s large numbers of Mexicans enter the US as irregulars, many times more than are admitted through legal labour programs. Governments turn a blind eye to this source of cheap labour until 1973, the year of the Oil Shock, when the media and politicians suddenly start to talk of the threat posed by illegal immigrants. In 1978 the CIA Director claims that Mexican illegals pose a greater security threat than the Soviet Union! Despite this, the key economic role of irregular migrants leads to a 1986 government amnesty, allowing over 2.6 million to legally stay. In 2010 Arizona </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html"><span class="pt-Hyperlink-000014">passes a law</span></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013"> to criminalise and deport anyone not carrying valid immigration documents. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Australia Despite formal adherence to “White Australia”, post-WWII governments gradually widen criteria of who can settle because of intense demand for labour. While net migration is scaled back a little in the 1970s it remains high and there is acceptance of over 90,000 Vietnamese refugees by the Fraser government. In the early 1990s policies against boat arrivals are toughened by the Keating government, introducing mandatory detention. This policy is extended by Howard even though net immigration rises to historically high levels in the 2000s. Temporary work visas also become much more common compared with permanent residency. While the details vary, some important patterns emerge across these countries. Firstly, while politicians publicly separate “refugees” from “economic” migrants, and “legal” from “illegal” migration, such terms are used arbitrarily and politically. Migrants decide to move from their homes and networks of support for complex reasons, and their choices of route and method of migration (as well as destination) depends very much on their particular circumstances. What drives the responses of receiving states is much more related to economic and political trends within those societies. So the post-WWII boom saw active programs to encourage immigration, whether legal or illegal. Governments were willing to bend rules (on legality or ethnic origin) to ensure workforces grew. With the onset of economic instability in the 1970s, increased emphasis was placed on the politics of perceived threats posed by migration, but usually by separating off a minority grouping as illegitimate and then focusing publicly-visible coercive efforts on them. Overall migration levels have remained relatively high, and large-scale amnesties for “illegal” immigrants (not just in the US but in many European countries) make a mockery of apparently tough distinctions between different groups of migrants. The terms used to define migrants therefore depend on how particular states choose to label and manage particular groups. So “skilled migrants” can be praised while “boat people” are treated as unlawful. Those defenders of refugees, like the Greens, who </span><a href="http://greensmps.org.au/content/media-release/population-debate-should-not-demonise-asylum-seekers"><span class="pt-Hyperlink">call for cuts in the former to allow more of the latter</span></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, tacitly accept the notion that there is a moral and/or technical distinction between the two groups somehow separate to politics. Secondly, the terminology regarding refugee rights in the 1951 Geneva Convention has been interpreted in different ways depending on the political intent of those applying it. More recently some Western governments have toyed with rejecting the Convention outright. The ability of states to do this suggests that a “rights”-based agenda to defend asylum seekers as “genuine” refugees is inadequate as the very definition of the rights being argued over is malleable and contested. The only consistent application would be to either ban all migration (a practical impossibility) or allow open borders, the latter idea once considered heretical but now increasingly discussed on both </span><a href="http://www.plutobooks.com/display.asp?K=9780745322445&amp;CID=metro"><span class="pt-Hyperlink">the Left</span></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> and </span><a href="http://www.cis.org.au/publications/policy-magazine/article/1317-open-the-borders"><span class="pt-Hyperlink">some parts of the libertarian Right</span></a><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">.Thirdly, while the era of “globalisation” since the 1980s has been defined by wealth being able to move around the globe more freely, it has been accompanied by greater restrictions on the rights of people to move. The very Western nations that have exported neoliberal policies to the Third World have also sought to curtail the migration of people who may be suffering from those policies. This has become more apparent when people from countries ravaged by wars (openly or tacitly) supported by Western governments have been denied entry into those rich nations. Thinking locally Finally,</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">it is worth examining in greater detail how domestic politics has been the key shaper of policies towards refugees specifically and migrants more generally. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">For nation states to manage variegated social groups within common borders requires the development of national identities based not just on shared attributes but definition in opposition to an “outside” or an “other”.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">If social groups</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">with differing and often opposed interests</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">are to be welded together ideologically, the state may see an interest in uniting them in common cause against foreign competitors or potential invaders. Yet at the same time, maintaining truly impervious national borders can be harmful to powerful economic interests</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Countries like Australia continue to be built on cheap migrant labour working alongside better-paid domestic workers. Short of closing borders completely, states repeatedly act to assert their ability to control who crosses them and the circumstances under which they cross them. This also gives states legitimacy in being able to manage domestic affairs. Local social and political factors then condition the relative weight of various policies and approaches.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">Across most Western nations, the end of the long post-war boom led to governments acceding to (and initiating) anti-immigrant sentiment. Times of economic hardship are not shared equally, with big business and the wealthy usually demanding policies to make the working class and poor pay disproportionately for the economic downturn. The era of neoliberalisation since the 1970s has generally led to greater inequality and massive concentrations of wealth at the top of society, which has increased feelings of social dislocation and insecurity at the base of society</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Mainstream politicians who have implemented neoliberal policies </span><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/41894.html"><span class="pt-Hyperlink">have thus undermined their own electoral support</span></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. One solution to this problem has been to build constituencies through appeals to nationalism, displacing social insecurity into fears about competition over jobs and wages, or threats of invasion or terrorism. John Howard was particularly attuned to this, dropping open advocacy of extreme economic rationalist policies while manoeuvring to maintain a constituency including some sections of Labor’s working class base around themes of nationalism and fear of the other. The War On Terror led to an </span><a href="http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3075043"><span class="pt-Hyperlink">increased focus on control and disciplining of Arab and Muslim migrants</span></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. Most often the intent is not to actually stop the flow of migrants but to show that the government can deal with one particular group it defines as particularly troublesome. Howard’s actions in tying the response to the Tampa with 9/11 served as a model for many other governments to base their increasingly harsh immigration policies on. Here governments use the coercive function of the state to show that they are protecting their citizens from these threats, even if the alleged threat is negligible and inconsistent with their other policies. Such actions are often temporarily effective in achieving a set goal - the Howard government’s Pacific Solution and harsh detention policies almost certainly kept boat arrival numbers low for a number of years. But they can also undermine political support over time, in part because they do not address the causes of social insecurity that they try to manage, and in part because their brutality provokes domestic dissent. Once Howard introduced WorkChoices, it was much harder for him to sell the idea that border security could keep people content, whatever residual anti-refugee sentiment existed in the community. Harsh restrictions can also make the government and state look weaker when they don’t work as promised. For example, Howard’s repeated redrawing of Australia’s migration borders risked reducing his policies to the level of farce. For Kevin Rudd, persisting with Howard’s line was untenable if he was to secure Labor’s vote, even if subsequent events have shown ALP leaders are still terrified they will be outgunned on migrant-bashing. It is in the context of political calculations that we can understand the David Cameron conundrum. Recognising that the Tory voter base has suffered secular decline, he </span><a href="http://www.zero-books.net/obookssite/book/detail/1107/The-Meaning-of-David-Cameron"><span class="pt-Hyperlink">has sought to reposition himself</span></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> as a small-l liberal on certain social issues, trying to attract well-educated white-collar workers by appearing to be to the Left of Labour.

In some national states (the United States since 1996 and Great Britain since 1999 for example), anyone subject to immigration controls, even those with legal, permanent status, are denied a plethora of services and benefits available only to the citizenry (Cohen, 2003, p. 40; Nevins, 2002). Moreover, there have been attempts to differentiate between citizens born in a national state and those who hold citizenship status through naturalization. For example, in Canada after the passing of the new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in 2002, it is easier to revoke the citizenship status of those whose citizenship was gained through naturalization instead of birth for several reasons, including being an (undefined) national security threat (CIC, 2002). Yet, very little of this kind of discrimination is questioned, even by many' progressives or those on the Left. In part, this is because </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">discrimination based on national citizenship is normalized through the global system of national states and the international law that regulates it and internalized by those with a national- subject identity</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">. In the founding Charter of the United Nations, for instance, the 'sovereign right' of national states to extend or deny membership is the pivot around which the national state system revolves</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">It is this juridically constructed right that allows national states of the Global North to deny entry as well as permanent or citizenship status to the vast majority of the world's migrants</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">, most especially to those from the Global South, </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">all while earning legitimacy for such actions</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> (Sharma, 2001).

Such stories work to neatly slide the relationship between capital and state. Through their telling, national states become merely the 'representative' of the people's power. The state is imagined as a retlection of the 'nation' instead of a very powerful institution that regulates and disciplines a group of people established as a discrete 'population'. National -states, therefore, escape any systemic challenge to their existence because they are evaluated on whether the rulers of the state are either proper representatives, and therefore 'democratic'. or non-representative and. as such. dictators.' A corollary to this is the attempted re-education of the 'nation' (anti-sexist. anti-racist campaigns, and so on). so as to ensure a state that supposedly represents all its citizens. Within liberal democracies like Canada. the existence of a group of people considering themselves to be the nation (or civil society). and therefore not as being ruled over but as ruled for. helps to secure ruling relations and the continued existence of the national state. in other words. the construction of a civil or social sphere that 'citizens' inhabit becomes a way to naturalize the power of the state to rule. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">By claiming to represent the 'national family'. the state secures its power over both its members and those positioned as their negative reference point. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">Stories of national sovereignty re-present global economic. social and political inequalities as a manifestation of the individual national state one lives in, reproducing the myth that there are, in fact, 'national society' that fall or rise according to their own domestic disputes. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">What remains concealed is how historically the very ability for some national states to be more or less 'sovereign' than others is a result of how they are positioned in a globalized set of power relationships</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The 'uneven development' between so-called 'stronger' and 'weaker' states</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. then, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">becomes not a nationally constituted phenomenon but a consequence of a global real politik</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> (Amin. 1974; Frank, I967).

As such, the material basis for any 'clash' is ignored, thereby relegating the war on terror to the realm of primordial, naturalized defense of 'civilized' people against 'barbarians'. What is also accomplished is the wholesale denial of any responsibility for the production and realization of terror from those who are able to self-define themselves as the sole victims of it. In the dialectic story of national identity and state power, neither 'the people' nor the state can afford to have a breach in their imagi(nation) of space and identity. In this, the obfuscation of terrorism through border controls is essential. Broadly speaking, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">national state controls on citizenship and immigration distinguish members from non-members and by virtue of their 'belonging', grant members rights and entitlements legitimately denied to the nation's Others</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. Acts of nationalized discrimination, therefore. materially secure the national subject identity of those that do 'belong'. It is for this reason that in Canada's participation in the war on terror, the figure of the 'foreign' trespasser/terrorist has been selected as the central object of state coercive power.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000001"> </span></p><h4 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading4"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">The invitation and normalization of proper neoliberal subjects is the psycho-social method of capitalism that locks in its worst abuses</span></h4><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000005"><span class="pt-Style13ptBold">Brown 16</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> Constellations, Vol. 23, No. 1, March 2016 Professor at U.C.

To grasp how and why this occurs, however, we must return to the general problematic of neoliberal governance formations and consider in particular two of its component parts, devolution and responsibilization. Devolution, Responsibilization and Shared Sacrifice Neoliberalism’s economization of the political, its jettisoning of the very idea of the social, and its displacement of politics by governance diminishes all significant venues for active citizenship. One can see these three forces combined in the metrics by which the costs of higher education are now appraised — on the one hand, in terms of the investment by consumers in their own economic future, on the other hand in terms of the investment by the state in its economic future. These metrics occlude the historical concern of higher education with developing or renewing citizens, knowledge, civilization, culture, or the public&amp;#39;s capacity to govern itself. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Another example of compressing democratic citizenship and democratic justice into economic purposes can be seen in</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> President </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Obama’s 2013 “State of the Union” address</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">, delivered shortly after his re-election. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">In a speech soaring with calls for social justice and ecological renewal, each item in what many pundits saw as a revived progressive agenda was expressly legitimated by its contribution to economic growth</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">.

Indeed, if one item on Obama&amp;#39;s progressive agenda turns out to deter (or even fail to stimulate) growth, it would apparently have to get scratched from the program. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">This framing also reduces citizenship to participation in national growth and thus to political passivity, continuous with</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> (if more subtle than) G.W. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">Bush’s infamous encomium to “shop, fly, and spend” as consummate acts of patriotism in the immediate aftermath of 9/11</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">From a governance perspective, where what is prized is teamwork in achieving the goal of growth rather than contestation and deliberation about norms, there is no place for agitated or agonistic citizenship.

However, while neoliberal political rationality administered through governance eliminates the last classical republican traces of citizenship formulated as public engagement, it retains even as it transforms the idea of citizen sacrifice. If </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">citizen virtue is reworked as responsibilized entrepreneurialism</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">, it is also reworked as the “shared sacrifice” potentially required for a healthy or troubled but above all a flexible economy. Such sacrifice may range from suffering the direct effects of job outsourcing, furloughs or pay and benefits cuts, to suffering the indirect effects of stagflation, credit crunches, liquidity or currency crises. It may be shared widely as the curtailed state investment in education; it may be suffered individually as a “last-hired, first-fired” phenomenon; or, as is most often the case, it may be suffered disproportionately by a weak group or class, as is the case with furloughs or reduced government services. Whatever the case, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">active citizenship is slimmed to tending oneself as responsibilized human capital, while sacrificial citizenship expands to include anything related to the health of a firm or nation, or again, the health of the nation as firm</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. This slimming and expansion are facilitated through the neoliberal supplanting of democratic political values and discourse with governance, that consensus model of order that integrates all into a supervenient project. Recall that governance replaces law with guidelines related to project goals, conflicting class positions with “stakeholders,” class consciousness with team consciousness, and political or normative challenges with a focus on the technical and the practical. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">It is through such replacements and the reduction of national political purpose to economic survival and growth that, for example, tax-paying workers become an acceptable revenue source for the bailouts of investment banks managed by billionaires.

It is not simply that the international population is managed, but that we come to manage ourselves through the confessionary complex. Foucault Mark B. Salter 181 describes the importance of "</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">the way by which, through some polit- ical technology of individuals, we have been led to recognize our- selves as a society, as a part of a social entity, as a part of nation or of a state</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">."63 Balibar relates the governmental function of the bor- der as the limit of community to the process of identity-formation: "</span><span class="pt-Emphasis">The normality of the national citizen-subject ... is also internal- ized by individuals, as it becomes a condition, an essential refer- ence of their collective, communal sense, and hence of their iden- tity. ... As a consequence, borders cease to be purely external realities.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">"64 </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">The confessionary complex is a structure framed by law and instantiated in various practices at the border</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> (and in the faces of agents of the state) . </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">This is doubly true in the case of terrorism, which is not vis- cerally visible</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. The exceptional application of law in this instance is also revealing of the weakness of Agamben in explaining the moment of decision. In US vs. Montoya de Hernandez, the Supreme Court held that for offense for which there will be "no external signs... inspectors will rarely possess probably cause to arrest or search, yet governmental interests in stopping smuggling at the border are high indeed."65 As with general searches at the border, the standard of probable cause is held in abeyance at the body/border. Terror is similar to alimentary canal smuggling (swal- lowing balloons of cocaine in this instance), in that the signs of the bad intent are secondary: nervousness, discomfort, anxiety. This </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">confessionary complex is also written on the body in terms of embodied anxiety and the signs of untruth: "a ... mechanism of shame that makes one blush at expressing any bad thought</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">."66 Thus, reasonable suspicion must be visible not only in the body but in the mind of a border guard. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The examination at the border is a corporeal documentary affair. As Gillian Fuller suggests, "States don't deal with strange peculiarities of networked and virtualised individuals, they prefer to keep the subject within the more know- able constraints of identity</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">."67 Thus, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">at the border the document is compared to the body which is compared to the story. If the iso- morphism between this body-dossier-narrative tests the guard's credibility, exclusion looms. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">This lighter "reasonable suspicion" standard is applied to other travelers at the airport. In US v. Sokolaw, the court argued that adherence to a law enforcement profile, which does not meet the standard of probable cause, may meet the standard of reasonable suspicion. The case revolved around a drug smuggler detained due to a number of suspicious activities that met a particular profile. The court upheld that meeting an established profile would lead to reasonable suspicion and thus grant law enforcement the to stop the traveler.68 Consequently the test of reasonable suspi- cion, tied with the exceptional state of the border, leads to the rule by decision. However the moment of decision must be disaggre- gated. What are these profiles? How are they managed? How are decisions made? Since Agamben neglects this moment of decision, focusing as he does on the capacity for decision, we must turn to anthropologists or sociologists of the border. This leads to consideration of the agents of discretion.

Didier Bigo suggests that within the European context the emergence of a cohort of migration managers has shifted policing "from the control of and hunt for individual criminals ... to the surveillance of so-called risk groups, defined by using criminology and statistics."74 </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The reliance on technology to cope with the rapidly increasing number and variety of risk profiles should be viewed with skepticism</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">: "Notwithstanding the increasing appeal to sophisticated computer-based models within geodemographics, the systems persist in relying on stereotypical images, and on small-scale narratives of dispositions and their intended consequences."75 </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The credibility of the entrant's story becomes crucial to the decision to admit or reject, a decision that is always made on the basis of insuf- ficient evidence and mistrust of the speaker, and complicated by an incomplete documentary trail.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> It is clear that the right to be pre- sumed innocent or to have a fair trial must be held in abeyance at the border under the twin rubrics of efficiency and security. These social scripts are reached through the auto-confession of the body, through the presumption in training that the examined body will confess even if the soul is reluctant. This </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">auto-confession happens through the interpretation of body, face, teeth, clothes, posture, and language skills as evidence of class, social group, eth- nicity, gender, sexuality.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> It also is assumed to happen through the examination process. Psychologist Paul Ekman trains law enforce- ment officials and others in his theory of "micro-expressions," by which interrogators can learn the self-confessing secrets of facial expressions that last one twenty-fifth of a second.76 Training for Canada Customs agents in the past has focused on this kind of visual acuity, described by one agent as training in "one of these things is not like the other." Other technologies on offer to the security apparatus of the state include heat cameras that detect blush responses around the eyes during deception and motion sen- sors that detect awkward or abnormal movement. Thus, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">a corpo- real lens makes visible to us the ways in which the body comes to testify, along with our documents, about our intentions, character, utility, moral quality, and social and economic origins</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. If we do not confess in a way that echoes with the story that the examiner has told him/herself about us, then we are suspect. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The confessionary dynamic is illustrated by the ubiquitous "no joking" rule now posted at most airports</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. In the words of the Cana- dian Air Transport Security Authority, "you should never joke or make 'small talk' about bombs, firearms or other weapons while going through pre-board screening."77 </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Small talk and jokes are dangerous because they express untruths. But border examiners rely on the anxiety of the passenger and themselves to affect obe- dience, examination, and confession</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. Like doctors, judges, and teachers, we must all tell the truth to agents of the state: not just the truth from a certain point of view, but the whole, entire, self- policing truth. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">These regulations against joking and small talk train travelers to self-police their speech and behavior to present a low-risk profile toward the authority figure.

The Valley’s prestigious high-tech companies, such as Apple, Intel, Hewlitt Packard, Oracle and IBM, could not function without this labour force.

Although Silicon Valley is situated in the most prosperous county in the US, aggregate wealth on closer examination decomposes 208 into a scene of postindustrial segmentation where "the First World meets the Third in a weird melange of high technology and misery."18 For many years, the dispersed nature of the Silicon Valley service workforce, its high turnover, and divided ethnic composition, led the US labour movement to deem it unorganisable. In the early 1990s, however, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">following a wave of worker complaints, Justice for Janitors, an organisation of Services Employees International Union, began a series of campaigns fighting for union recognition, pay raises, and settlement of sexual harassment grievances.19 These campaigns used a wide variety of tactics--strikes, picket lines, demonstrations, advertisements, leafleting campaigns, hunger strikes---which, although all part of the historic repertoire of the American labour movement, were conducted with an energy and determination that contrasted sharply with the submissive defeatism prevailing in many major trades unions. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">Moreover, in some respects the Justice for Janitors campaigns went beyond familiar models of shopfloor activism. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">They made connections between workplace conditions and issues of race and gender discrimination, and forged alliances with feminist and ethnic community organisations</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">.

Australian </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">immigration officials often describe the point system as a "</span><span class="pt-Emphasis">transparent and objective method of selecting skilled migrants with the skills and attributes" that are valued by the admitting society.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> 42 These permanent skills-based programs accounted for over two thirds (67.4 percent) of Australia's permanent migration intake in 2010-2011. 43 New Zealand then followed suit, adopting its own variant of the point system to attract the highly skilled. The technique of engendering targeted and selective skills-based admission and settlement routes has since been "exported" to the four corners of the world. New competitors, including some that until very recently did not define themselves as immigration nations (Germany is a prime example), have become more agile and more focused on recruiting global talent.44 In 2000, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">European leaders reached agreement on the Lisbon Agenda, committing European Union nations "</span><span class="pt-Emphasis">to the goal of becoming 'the world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy,' particularly in "the competition for people</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">." 45 Since 2000, the share ofresearchers in the EU-27 countries has grown at double the pace as it has in both the United States and Japan, although the EU still lags behind these competitors in absolute numbers. 46 The focus has been on making the transition to EU countries smoother for skilled professionals and on easing the rules affecting the recruitment of international students, especially those excelling in the fields of science and engineering-the very same talent pool that is already the target of fierce competition. 47 Within the first decade of the twenty-first century, some of the more dynamic Asian economies, such as Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea, began to recruit globally. Once emigration countries, they are now trying to lure back their most eminent national scientists by extending them generous resettlement offers. China and India, the major sending countries of highly-skilled migrants, are also weighing in. India has seen the skyrocketing growth of new technology hubs such as Bangalore, often referred to as the Silicon Valley of India.48 The economic impact of India's technology-inclined services is huge, making it attractive for bright young engineers and entrepreneurs to stay at home rather than seeking better fortunes abroad, while at same time enticing the country's extensive scientific diasporas in North America and Europe to return. China, for its part, has adopted a multipronged strategy, a key feature of which is tremendous governmental investment in basic sciences and their commercial applications. It is now the world's second largest producer of scientific knowledge, measured by indicia such as number of articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, trailing only the United States. 49 As part of its One-Thousand-Talent program, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">China is also aggressively using financial, taxation, and membership perks to attract high-caliber international scholars and returning Chinese citizens</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> to lead key laboratories, projects and disciplines in China.50 Perfecting the technique of targeted admission routes, China is also adopting a more flexible approach that allows mid-career scholars to spend part of the year in China, and the rest in the West. In this way, the country is gaining significant knowledge transfers without insisting on permanent settlement as a precondition for repatriation benefits.51 These changes in policy and in attitude, along with stronger growth prospects in emerging markets, have created a pattern of "return migration" by successful emigrants who have settled in richer countries abroad. 52 </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The economic crisis has generally seen a slowdown in labor migration</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. 53 </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Unexpectedly, however, it has also furthered, rather than hindered, the attractiveness of skills-based categories</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">Policymakers increasingly draw a connection between highly-skilled migration, job creation, capital investment, and boosting competitiveness</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. 54 Politically, </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">the admission and settlement of the highly skilled is accepted more readily by the public in comparison to other immigration streams and</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-Emphasis">policies</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">. 55</span></p><h3 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading3"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000003">1NC – Anti-Trafficking</span></h3><h4 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading4"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">Anti-trafficking campaigns provide a thin veneer of humanitarianism to projects of domination at the border and within the nation state—neoliberal capitalism, which you entrench, better explains migration and its roots. </span></h4><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000005"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Style13ptBold">Sharma 15 </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">NANDITA SHARMA 30 March 2015 </span><a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/beyondslavery/nandita-sharma/antitrafficking-whitewash-for-antiimmigration-programmes"><span class="pt-Hyperlink-000014">https://www.opendemocracy.net/beyondslavery/nandita-sharma/antitrafficking-whitewash-for-antiimmigration-programmes</span></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> Nandita Sharma, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Hawai‘i at Manoā, and Director of its International Cultural Studies Graduate Certificate Program “</span><span class="pt-Emphasis">Anti-trafficking: whitewash for anti-immigration programmes</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">”</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">National immigration policies and their enforcement constitute the greatest dangers to people trying to cross national borders</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">.

The reasons why it is increasingly difficult and dangerous for people to move safely or live securely in new places are brushed aside while </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Emphasis">nation states rush to criminalise ‘traffickers’ and (largely) deport ‘victims of trafficking.’ </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">To have a useful discussion about ‘trafficking’ and ‘modern-day slavery,’ we need to take seriously how national and international governance regimes and legislation shape the experiences of people trying to exit, move across, or live and work in various nationalised societies. The United Nations estimates there were 232 million international migrants in 2013, 57 million more than there were in 2000. Today, much (but not all) of human migration is shaped by the enormous spatial disparities in prosperity, peace and power. In contrast to the “great age of mass migration” of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when migration was mainly out of Europe, most cross-border migrants today originate from the ‘poor world.’ This is not a surprise given that one’s nationality is a key factor in predicting global income disparity. Branko Milanovic demonstrates in his 2005 book Worlds Apart: Measuring International and Global Inequality that citizens of ‘rich world’ nation-states enjoy an enormous “citizenship premium.” For example, a citizen of the United States with “the average income of the bottom US decile is better off than 2/3 of world population” (Milanovic 2005, p. 50, emphasis added). </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">How have nation-states, especially in the ‘rich world,’ responded to this growth in international migration and the growth in global disparities? Not by helping people move or by making their migration routes safe </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">but by implementing more restrictive and punitive immigration and border controls than ever</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. However, this has not stopped people from moving and, arguably, this is not the states’ goal. While more and more people are moving, they have access to less and less rights and entitlements. For example, in the United States, the largest category of ‘migrants’—by a ratio of about 15:1—are those denied state permission to either enter or stay in the country. In Canada, the largest group of “migrants” are categorised as “temporary foreign workers” who are not free to choose either their employer, occupation or geographical residence. Thus, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">far from eliminating or even severely restricting the movement of people, what neoliberal reformulations of immigration and refugee policy have done is to prevent the vast majority of migrating people from making claims on the state</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> (in terms of social services) or on employers (in terms of minimum wages and standards of work). </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">That is how a ‘cheap’ and ‘disposable’ labour force is created</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">This is the real story of international migration in the age of neo-liberalism</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> (late 1960s onward): the creation of a legally subordinated group of people cast as ‘migrants.’ </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">It is precisely in this same period that the narratives of ‘modern-day slavery’ and ‘victims of trafficking’ have arisen</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">This is not a coincidence</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">.

It is true that many, but certainly not all, migrants experience coercion and even abuse during their journeys. They may also experience some form of deception if the jobs, wages or working conditions they expected do not materialise. Does this mean that they are ‘victims of trafficking’ as some NGOs, almost all national governments, and the United Nations would have us believe? They are not. Instead, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">most people who migrate, especially those cast as ‘illegals’ or ‘temporary foreign workers,’ are victims of the daily, banal operation of global capitalist labour markets that are governed by nation-states.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> These practices make migration a survival strategy. People are further victimised by border control practices and the ideologies of racism, sexism, and nationalism that render unspectacular their everyday experiences of oppression and exploitation, which are rarely considered worthy of our attention. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">By vilifying the ‘trafficker,’ anti-trafficking crusaders further depoliticize state immigration policies, border controls and the capitalist market. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">To address the needs and desires of people who move—and to acknowledge extant global disparities in power, wealth and peace—we need to re-politicize nation-states and their immigration and border controls.

Only a very small number of migrants have received temporary legal status as a result of being positioned as victims of trafficking. For the vast majority of people migrating, however, the focus on ‘traffickers’ has made people’s clandestine journeys more expensive and more dangerous, as avoiding detection and arrest has become increasingly difficult.

Governments, for example, suspend essential civil liberties in times of social crisis and decide who can be excluded and who can be included. In this sense, the logic of the camp is transformed into a form of sociality and is generalized (p. 20; pp. 174–175); consequently, the camp signifies a state of exception that is normalized in the contemporary social space (p. 166). In the state of exception or what Agamben calls “a zone of irreducible indistinction” (1998, p. 9), “the originary relation of law to life is not application but abandonment” (p. 29). “He who has been banned is not, in fact, simply set outside the law and made indifferent to it but rather abandoned by it, that is, exposed and threatened on the threshold in which life and law, outside and inside, become indistinguishable” (p. 28, author’s emphasis). Following Foucault, Agamben claims that </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">the contemporary state is not based on citizens as free subjects, but on citizens as naked lives; that is, citizens on the threshold, never once and for all ‘in’ or ‘out’</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Ek, 2006). For Edkins and Pin-Fat (2005), Agamben’s ‘bare life’ is essentially a life without power relations, that is, a relationship of violence, in the Foucauldian sense (see Foucault, 1983). </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">This hidden incorporation of bare life into both the political realm and the structure of citizenship, according to Agamben, </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">inscribes dangerous links among citizenship, nation and biological kinship</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Ziarek, 2008); </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">those links are ‘legalized’ in a modern sovereign state and citizenship education curricula (especially those grounded in liberal/humanitarian arguments) simply perpetuate this ‘legality’</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (see Knight Abowitz &amp; Harnish, 2006). Agamben takes a step further in his investigation of sovereign state and political rights by going back to a figure of archaic Roman law, homo sacer (literally ‘sacred man’), referring to an individual who can be killed (without consequences) but not sacrificed (in religious rituals). Homo sacer, then, is essentially someone beyond the protection of the law (with no political rights) or even worthy to be sacrificed. According to Agamben’s account, homo sacer is an essential figure permeating western thought. His double exclusion—both from human law and divine law—is also a double inclusion: the exclusion of both the sacred and the profane (Edkins, 2003). For Agamben, homo sacer is not only a figure in the legal philosophy of ancient Rome, but is also a subject of recurrent materializations in history (Dean, 2004). </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">It is through the state of exception as seen in mechanisms of colonization that Western states have become involved in the differentiation and categorization of people</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Diken &amp; Laustsen, 2005; Ek, 2006). In other words, it </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">is the nexus between the materialization of the state of exception</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (e.g., through </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Emphasis">inhumane detention centers and other migration and refugee camps throughout the world) and the fear for the figure of the immigrant/ refugee/asylum seeker that reveals the limitations in the framework of both state-centric perspectives and liberal humanitarian views </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">(Papastergiades, 2006). A crucial notion in the understanding of the camp and the state of exception is uncovered here, according to Ek (2006): the connection between colonialism/racism and biopolitics. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">That is, one form of life (the immigrant/refugee/asylum seeker) is separated out in an act of colonialism/racism and imagined as</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> an </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">abject</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> figure of fear and a threat to another form of life (the ‘society’). As the logic of the camp becomes more generalized in society, the production of naked life is thus extended beyond the camp’s walls; the camp replaces polis, as Agamben argues, and therefore the Aristotelian distinction between polis and naked life, collapses. An Alternative Politics and Discourse of Citizenship Education Agamben’s analysis of biopower offers a valuable basis for developing an alternative response to the liberal/humanitarian discourses of citizenship, because Agamben traces and specifies explicitly the problematic in the priority given to national security and citizenship over moral obligation to the Other (Papastergiadis, 2006). </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Liberal and humanitarian discourses grounded in human rights or principles of justice remain blind to the biopolitical aspects</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> analyzed in Agamben’s work (Ek, 2006). </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">The problem with liberal/humanitarian arguments is that they appropriate the figure of the Other in ways that “elide the substantive differences between ways of being displaced from ‘home”</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Ahmed, 2000, p. 5). </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">Differences are concealed by universalizing the condition of displacement and by placing all immigrants/ refugees/asylum seekers into a singular category, as if they all experience the same thing.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> Agamben’s point—which takes him beyond a familiar critique of rejecting singularities—is to </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">question the very notions of humanity, citizenship and the rule of law within the modern nation state which make possible the generalization of the logic of the cam</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">p. In this part of the article, I want to consider how Agamben’s views can ‘trouble’ current understandings of citizenship education (Richardson &amp; Blades, 2006) and expand the set of meanings around citizenship. In their review of contemporary discourses of citizenship, Knight Abowitz and Harnish (2006) urge educators and curriculum theorists to build on the strong array of diverse critical discourses of citizenship (e.g., critical citizenships, transnationalism) because these discourses challenge traditional definitions of bounded membership and push “against traditional boundaries of agency, identity, and membership” (p. 680). Cosmopolitan (Nussbaum, 1997), transnational (Bauböck, 1994) and post-national (Soysal, 1994) views have challenged normative meanings of identity, membership, citizenship practice, and education. Although critical and transnational perspectives are certainly included in scholarly debates, point out Knight Abowitz and Harnish (2006), “the current formal, taught curriculum of citizenship produces a relatively narrow scope and set of meanings for what citizenship is and can be” (p. 657). The question is: How can Agamben’s ideas enrich the current taught curriculum of citizenship? For Agamben, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">to turn only to liberal/humanitarian (e.g., human rights) discourses in addressing the situation of others (i.e., immigrants/refugees/asylum seekers), without also attempting to think beyond such discourses, is to fail to recognize that “the fates of human rights and the nation-state are bound together such that the decline and crisis of one necessarily implies the end of the other” </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">(1998, p. 134). Agamben seems to be suggesting that it is very important to understand the devastating consequences of bounded membership; critical citizenships can certainly align forces with Agamben’s views on interrogating bounded membership. Faced with increased migration after the Second World War, </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">Europe and the United States in particular, have gradually created an increasingly complex system of civic stratifications and immigration procedures that is dependent on bounded membership and the immigrant/refugee/asylum seeker</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> as a fearsome figure who threatens ‘our’ bounded membership (Tyler, 2006). The results are millions of stateless people inside the territorial states and inhumane citizenship and migration policies and practices (Ek, 2006). As it has already been noted, Agamben’s analysis reveals all the shortcomings of the intersection between fearism and liberal/ humanitarian discourses of citizenship that are still founded in territorial myths—myths that ignore the biopolitical matrix (Minca, 2006). Agamben essentially asks us to see the current juridico-political frame as ideology with material implications; at the center of this ideological frame is the bourgeois nation–state, which bestows individuals with ‘rights’ and progressively incorporates them into a body (the nation). For instance, the expression “I love or hate them because they are like me, or not like me” (Ahmed, 2005, p. 108) indicates the ideological aspects that collective bodies entail. Hence in hating an Other, a subject also loves itself and those that are similar to itself. This attachment structures political life within a community and provides an affective orientation that characterizes the thinking of this community (or nation). As Kristeva (1993) argues, the nation is an effect of how bodies move toward it and create boundaries. The citizens become members of the body–nation, members to be managed, measured in certain ways, and contained (Minca, 2007). Thus </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">the definition of belonging to the nation “becomes the state’s guiding political preoccupation</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. […] </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">It is within this exclusive inclusion…that the very principle of citizenship and the idea(l) of belonging are born” (</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">p. 88). </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Emphasis">When the nation–state begins to systematically isolate a bare life—endowed with citizenship ‘rights’ or not—then citizenship becomes definable only in terms of the camp, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">as Agamben asserts. Critical and transnational discourses on citizenship can use Agamben’s views to raise questions about identity, membership and citizenship—questions that are issues of public debate, yet in curricular texts such questions are marginalized (Knight Abowitz &amp; Harnish, 2006). For example, </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">immigrants/refugees/asylum seekers can be considered as ‘limit concepts’</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (e.g., see Agamben, 1994) </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">to radically call into question the fundamental categories of the nation–state, including rights and citizenship.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> Immigrants/refugees/asylum seekers are powerful figures that invite educators, curriculum theorists, students, and the whole community to confront the politics of what Agamben has described as ‘inclusive exclusion.’ This inclusive exclusion brings to mind Kristeva’s (1982) view of the abject. </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000001"> </span></p><h3 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading3"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000003">1NC – Immigration</span></h3><h4 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading4"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">Quicker, more efficient immigration is fundamental to capital accumulation</span></h4><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000005"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Style13ptBold">Mason 17 </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">“The Intersection of Capitalism and Immigration” Eric Mason is a labor economist who works in the public sector February 21st, 2017</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">The H-T Model examines </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">the transition of workers between rural areas and urban areas</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, but “rural” and “urban” </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">could be better understood as agricultural work and manufacturing work</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, respectively. While this model offers us a wide array of insight into such concepts as urban economics, geospatial economics, and developmental economics, we are concentrating on the implication the model has on the field of labor economics. In regards to immigration, the H-T Model shows that </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">if unrestricted immigration from the rural sector to the urban is allowed, as long as labor demands are not exhausted, there should be an increase in wages</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> for all in the urban sector. In a more general sense, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">unrestricted immigration between non-developed areas and developed areas results in the net receiving sector increasing wages</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> for all in that sector. Conversely, if the immigration to the urban sector exhausts the labor demand, the Model demonstrates (and we see it in places like Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) that slums will appear on the outskirts of the urban sector. The slums form because individuals behave in their best interests; the allure of the higher wages in urban sector attracts laborers who are willing to take a chance of being destitute to secure a higher wages. The key take away from the H-T Model, regarding immigration, is as long as there is a surplus demand in labor, immigration leads to broad increases in wages in developed economies. These two foundational models lead us to the most widely accepted and crucial model for understanding economic growth, the Solow Growth Model. Developed by Nobel Laureate Robert Solow, and independently by Trevor Swan, in the mid-1950s, the Solow growth Model is arguably the single most influential model in modern economics. The model boils down to one basic proof, economies grow when they accumulate capital faster than the capital they have depreciates. But wait a minute, why aren’t we talking about labor? We are, but </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">economies are the result of two inputs: labor and capital.

This facet of neoliberal rule is clearly visible, for instance, in the widespread popularity of tough-on-crime sentencing regimes of just desserts, deterrence, and retribution. These regimes include such measures as quality-of-life campaigns and zero- tolerance policing, harsher penalties and the extensive utilization of imprisonment, three strikes and compulsory minimum sentencing policies, redress in juvenile court and the incarceration of minors, and extensive parole restrictions (Garland 2001, 12). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">Governing through crime is further visible in the common practice of securitizing private spaces as a way of dealing with crime risks and insecurities.

We can illustrate the impact of immigration enforcement as a form of racial governance using as examples</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> the blockading of the U.S.- Mexico border, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">workplace raids, and local police involvement in immigration matters. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">At the U.S.-Mexico border it “appears” that the amassing of personnel, technology, and infrastructure has had the desired effect of reducing the flow of undocumented immigrants into the United States. We can get a sense of this reduction from the number of people apprehended while attempting to cross the Southwest border without authorization. From a high of 1,643,679 in 2000, the number decreased to 327,577 in 2011 (U.S. Border Patrol 2012b). This is certainly a precipitous drop, fiowever, it is not clear that this reduction can actually be attributed to increased enforcement. The recession that began in 2007 (and arguably continues into 2013) has no doubt been the most significant factor affecting the flow of undocumented immigrants (Aguilera 2011). With the decline in employment opportunities, many would-be migrants have simply decided to stay home, at least for the time being. According to immigration scholar Wayne Cornelius, for most potential border crossers, the act of migrating is merely being postponed until the U.S. economy recovers (Mac 2010). But if it is the case that enhanced border policing has had an impact on stemming the flow of illicit bodies, this success has come with a rather high price: that of undocumented immigrant life. In some ways, the U.S.-Mexico border has always been a place of danger for those trying to cross it illegally (Nevins 2002). Immigrants have had to traverse the Rio Grande and other fast-moving waterways under the cover of darkness, to travel in sealed and inadequately ventilated freight compartments of trains or trucks, to trek through the desert terrain of the American Southwest, and to climb fences and other steel barriers erected by the U.S. government to secure the border (Eschbach et al. 1999). Given such danger, clandestine border crossings have sometimes had tragic consequences. Over the years, more than a few migrants—</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">it is hard to say exactly how many—have lost their lives trying to reach the United States. Today, crossing the border has become considerably more difficult and dangerous</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Nevins 2002; Inda 2006b; Doty, this volume). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">As the Border Patrol has closed off traditional illicit routes into the United States</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">—namely urban locations such as San Diego and El Paso—the migrant traffic has been channeled through remote and less policed mountain and desert locations. These </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">out-of-the-way places through which most unauthorized immigrants are currently crossing the borde</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">r—the deserts of Arizona, for example-—</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">are less than ideal entry points.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> Fust, the fact that they are apt to be far removed from urban centers means that the undocumented now have to walk long distances, often for days, before reaching areas where they can be picked up and transported elsewhere. Second, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">there is the rugged terrain of the new crossing places. Because they tend to be barren deserts or mountains, anyone entering through them potentially has to contend with freezing temperatures at night and torrid weather during the day. What having to walk long distances though hostile landscape means, basically, is a rather perilous border crossing experience</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. The peril is so great that border-crossing-related deaths have become routine events. In 1994, prior to the full implementation of the Border Patrol’s strategy of prevention through deterrence, there were only 24 recorded migrant deaths (Jimenez 2009, 17). By contrast, in 2007, the peak year for migrant fatalities, an estimated 827 border crossers lost their lives (ibid.). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">The American Civil Liberties Union calculates that, altogether, between 1994 and 2008 an estimated 5,607 migrants, mainly Mexicans, died</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">attempting to enter the United States</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> without authorization—that’s an average of about 374 migrant deaths per year (ibid.). All indications are, then, that enhanced boundary policing has made illicit border crossing a more hazardous venture. Indeed, there is little doubt that as the traffic of illicit bodies has moved from urban areas to rural locations, the risk of death has become greater and the border has become an exhibit of </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">death. Significantly, the fact that large numbers of border-crossers are dying has not escaped the Border Patrol’s attention</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. The agency actually seems quite concerned about this development. In 1998, for example, it created the Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue Unit (BORSTAR) to focus on the search and rescue of migrants in distress (US CBP 2009b). However, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">although the Border Patrol may have acknowledged that immigrants are dying and taken some steps to remedy the situation, the agency has not conceded that its operations brought about the problem in the first place. Indeed, the agency has failed to take any responsibility for the rise in migrant deaths. As one Border Patrol officer put it, “Death on the border is unfortunate, but it’s nothing new. It’s not caused by the Border Patrol. It’s not caused by [Operation] Gatekeeper” (Ellingwood 1999, A28). The logic behind this refusal to accept any blame is rather straightforward. The Border Patrol contends that it is simply doing its duty of safeguarding the nation s borders when it closes off busy urban crossing points. If immigrants consequently choose to cr</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">oss through rural terrains, the responsibility for any unfortunate incidents that may occur is deemed to lie not with the Border Patrol but with the immigrants themselves and the smugglers who guide them. The reality is, however, that as long as urban crossing points stay virtually closed and immigrants are steered to seek passage through risky mountain and desert locations, border crossers will continue to die. So, although the Border Patrol may not, strictly speaking, be liable for the fatalities at the border, it does bear a certain amount of responsibility for them because these deaths are an effect of the strict policing of the border. Indeed, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">immigrants are dying, and they are dying as a consequence of a stringent policy that propels them to cross the border through dangerous terrain. Shifting to the effects of interior policing, we find that workplace raids have also had a severely negative impact on immigrants and their communities. The most palpable impact of such raids has been their effect on the families, particularly the children, of the individuals who have been apprehended and deported</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. In 2007, the Urban Institute released a report titled Paying the Price: The Impact of Immigration Raids on America’s Children (Capps et al. 2007). The report focused on the aftermath of large-scale ICE raids in three communities: Greeley, Colorado; Grand Island, Nebraska; and New Bedford, Massachusetts. Greeley and Grand Island were two sites hit as part of a larger raid on Swift &amp; Company meat-processing facilities in six states (Colorado, Nebraska, Texas, Utah, Iowa, and Minnesota). New Bedford was the location of a raid on Michael Bianco, Inc., a textile product company. The authors detail how </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">the children and families of apprehended immigrants, who were mainly Latinos, experienced significant hardship, “including difficulty coping with the economic and psychological stress caused by the arrest and the uncertainty of not knowing when or if the arrested parent would be released”</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (ibid., 3). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Moreover, they note that hardship increased over time, as families' meager savings and funds from previous pay- checks were spent. Privately funded assistance generally lasted for two to three months, but many parents were detained for up to five or six months, and others were released but waited for several months for a final appearance before an immigration judge—during which time they could not work. Hardship also increased among extended families and nonfamily networks over time, as they took on more and more responsibility for taking care of children with arrested parents.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011"> After the arrest or disappearance of their parents, children experienced feelings of abandonment and showed symptoms of emotional trauma, psychological duress, and mental health problems.

Worksite raids have also helped to erode the rights of immigrant worke</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">rs. In a number of cases, ICE has conducted raids on workplaces that were in the middle of labor disputes or being investigated by other government agencies (such as the Department of Labor) for violation of workers’ rights (Smith, Avendano, and Martinez Ortega 2009). The Postville raid is particularly illustrative here. When the raid at Agriprocessors took place, at least three state and federal labor agencies were investigating the meatpacking plant for longstanding safety and workplace violations. Moreover, since 2006, the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union had been waging a campaign to organize workers at the plant. ICE was very well aware of this situation. On May 2, 2008, a week before the raid, the UFCW had sent a letter to the ICE special agent in charge of carrying out operations in Iowa, saying that the union was in the middle of an organizing campaign, that various local and federal labor agencies were investigating the plant, and that any immigration enforcement action would have a detrimental impact on labor rights. In the past, unions had achieved positive results with such letters, which alerted immigration officials to ongoing organizing efforts so that they would not interfere and undermine the enforcement of labor standards. The practice of sending letters was based on an internal ICE policy (put in place in 1996 by the INS) that cautioned agents about getting involved in labor disputes. The policy, initially known as Operating Instruction 287.3(a) and now redesignated 33.14(h) of the Special Agent Field Manual, specifies that when information is received concerning the employment of undocumented or unauthorized aliens, consideration should be given to whether the information is being provided to interfere with the rights of employees to form, join or assist labor organizations or to exercise their rights not to do so; to be paid minimum wages and overtime; to have safe work places; to receive compensation for work related injuries; to be free from discrimination based on race, gender, age, national origin, religion, handicap; or to retaliate against employees for seeking to vindicate these rights. (US INS 1996) In the case of Agriprocessors, ICE appears to have completely disregarded the policy, arresting hundreds of undocumented workers and in effect undermining the UFCW’s organizing campaign. It also appears that ICE carried out the raid without consulting the various agencies investigating safety and other violations at the plant, thus undermining their work as well (Smith, Avendano, and Martinez Ortega 2009). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">Although workplace raids have had a significant impact on immigrant populations, ICE’s ACCESS programs have undoubtedly had an even more profound effect</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. This is partly a matter of sheer numbers: more deportations have resulted from initiatives such as 287(g) than from raids. Just as important, however, is that </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">ICE ACCESS programs have generally- helped to disrupt the everyday lives of immigrants and produce a heightened sense of insecurity. As we have indicated, ICE’s law enforcement partners are supposed to target dangerous “criminal aliens,” but most immigrants who get caught are actually low-level offenders or people who simply crossed paths with local police.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> Clearly, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">what Is happening</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, at least in some locations, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">is that police officers are engaging in the heavy racial profiling of Latinos, making pretextual stops and arrests of people believed to be immigrants just so that their information</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (such as fingerprints) </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">can be checked against DHS databases</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">In Irving, Texas, for example, the number of Latinos arrested for minor offenses increased twofold following the expansion of the CAP program</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Gardner II and Kohli 2009). A </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">typical police tactic is to set up sobriety checkpoints or other traffic operations in or near immigrant neighborhoods</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. Once caught in these traps, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">immigrants without authorization to be in the United States are routinely arrested, often for driving without a license</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. More generally, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">it has become common for police to pull over</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> “</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">immigrant-appearing” drivers for no obvious reason or for minor traffic violations such as cracked windshields, broken taillights, improperly tinted windows, and so forth. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Not surprisingly, this targeted policing has produced a deep distrust of local police authorities among Latinos in communities where ICE ACCESS programs operate.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The distrust is such that Latinos</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">, particularly those without documents, are scared to have any kind of interaction with local police for fear that they will be punished or end up in deportation proceedings. In fact, it appears that some immigrants have been prompted to change their behavior patterns in order to dodge contact with police officers or other authorities</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">Studies have reported that immigrants are</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, for example, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">failing to report crimes against them, visiting local businesses with less frequency, curtailing interaction with schools and other institutions, altering their driving habits, venturing into public spaces less often, and in some cases leaving particular communities altogether</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Capps et al. 2011, 43). ICE ACCESS programs, then, have basically hampered the ability of immigrants to go about their daily lives, making them afraid to go out in public and have contact with any kind of authorities or institutions, and forcing some to look for a better life in more welcoming communities. Altogether, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">there is no doubt that the effect of current immigration policing practices has generally been to unsettle immigrant communities in the United States, Latinos in particular. A survey conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center in 2008 paints a rather grim picture of the psychological state of U.S. Latinos—legal residents, citizens, and undocumented immigrants alike (Lopez and Minushkin 2008). Latinos generally reported feeling anxious and discriminated against amid public immigrant bashing and enhanced immigration enforcement. Among the survey’s general findings were the following: within the year prior to the taking of the survey, one in ten Latinos, both citizens and noncitizens, reported being stopped by the police or other authorities and asked about their immigration status; one in seven said they had trouble finding or keeping a job because they are Latino; and one in ten reported difficulties finding or keeping housing. Significantly the survey also found that a majority of Latinos worry about deportation. Approximately 40 percent reported being worried “a lot” that they a family member, or a close friend would be deported, while 17 percent said they worried “some.” Not surprisingly immigrants are particularly concerned about deportation, with 72 percent reporting being worried either “a lot” or “some.”</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011"> In effect, then, the immigration enforcement climate has helped to create a sense of unease among Latinos, immigrants in particular. It has helped to produce an increased feeling of insecurity. Ultimately it is clear that the governing of migrant illegality today is not just about deterrence. It is also about incapacitation and attrition</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Gilbert, this volume). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">Indeed, the creation of insecurity among immigrants—by depriving them of the ability to participate meaningfully in quotidian life—appears to be a willful production designed to isolate this population from society and render them utterly powerless. It is a tactic that seeks to incapacitate immigrants, Latinos in particular, in order to wear down their will to work and live in the United States. Immigration policing, particularly in the interior, thus amounts to what has been called a policy of “attrition through enforcement”</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Krikorian 2006). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">The goal is not so much to actually expel all unauthorized immigrants as it is to “persuade” a large share of this population to self-deport</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">.As Mark Krikorian, executive director of the antiimmigrant Center for Immigration Studies, puts it, the idea is to “</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">prevent illegals from being able to embed themselves in our society.

More particu- larly the project requires both the expansion of forms to accommodate capacities and the expansion of capacities to make the realization of new forms possible. Such a project would reject the resolution of this contra- diction between capacities and forms through narrowing of capacities to fit existing forms or through the narrowing of forms to fit preconceived, fixed, “naturalized” notions of capacities.

Despite the talk of higher test scores, efficient instruction, and systematic learning, the program cannot lead to human emancipation. Although it may be argued that a tightly controlled beginning will eventually lead students to greater futures, this line of reason- ing suggests the narrowing of social forms to fit preconceived, fixed and nat- uralized notions of what their capacities might be in the future. Some may overcome the controlled beginning to use literacy to open opportunities in their lives, but some will also internalize the process of control, limiting the potential of their development. And of course, the scripted lives are all there is offered to teachers. They are never allowed to develop as teachers.

Organizational programs premised on empowerment are not uncommon in work-life policies, economic development initiatives, and non-profit mission statements. However, research suggests that certain approaches to empowerment such as those prioritizing individual responsibility and economic sustainability, may leave out important aspects of what empowerment can or should mean from different social locations (Sharma, 2008). Refugee resettlement agencies such as the Global Refugee Agency (GRA; pseudonym), the organizational context of this study, resettles refugees into local communities while piloting unique programs aimed at empowerment, independence, and selfsufficiency. While many of these objectives have positive effects on the community, empowerment discourses and practices could be better informed through critical rhetoric. Though empowerment programs predicated on economic participation may not be precise reflections of neoliberal subjectivity, they do “articulate with neoliberal principles” when prioritizing individualism, work ethics, and equality as defining features (Sharma, 2008, p. xviii). </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">Neoliberal subjectivity can be understood as produced by a governmentality which “installs in society a concept of human subject as autonomous, individualized, self-directed decision-making agent who becomes an entrepreneur of one self; a human capital” </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">(Türken, Nafstad, Blakar, &amp; Roen, 2016, p. 33). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">A materialist rhetoric understands non-governmental organizations to be “governing apparatuses”</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Greene, 2009, p. 54) </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">which reflect and instantiate the meaning of empowerment and disempowerment in practice</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. This study investigates the ways that large international humanitarian organizations such as the Global Refugee Agency both resist and remain complicit in the same systems of global inequality that produce the dispossession and displacement they seek to address. Sharma (2008) explains that </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">“under neoliberalism, empowerment has quickly become a preferred tool with which to produce self-governing and self-caring social actors, orient them towards the free market, direct their behaviors toward entrepreneurial ends, and attach them to the project of rule”</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Sharma, 2008, p. 20). For this reason, it is especially important that humanitarian agencies understand the organizational practices that participate in and resist neoliberal logics of empowerment. Studying the implications of situated organizational empowerment rhetoric and practices offers a more nuanced understanding of how these initiatives may constrain and enable certain bodies. Hill-Collins (1990) describes empowerment as a collectively-defined concept, emerging out of dialogic relationships among a community of people. In hierarchical organizational contexts there may be less opportunities for dialogue in the development and implementation of top-down defined empowerment programs, especially when those programs are aimed at underrepresented populations. Empirical criticism offers scholars and practitioners an opportunity to reflect on the ways organizations addressing forced migration can reify and resist systemic inequality. This analysis is one of a series of papers from a participant ethnography at a regional headquarters of one of the world’s largest international refugee resettlement and aid organizations (based in the United States), The Global Refugee Agency. The </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">study finds that empowerment rhetoric in resettlement contexts advocate for a specific model of success based on the values of consumerism, self-determination, and independence</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, which this study finds to be simultaneously enabling and limiting in scope and accessibility. The following research questions guided the analysis: How do Western resettlement organizational rhetoric and practices participate in and resist global systems of power? How do empowerment initiatives constitute refugees in ways that constrain and enable their agency? The following section addresses the rhetorical implications of dominant tropes in resettlement and empowerment work. The analysis highlights particularly salient examples of embodied rhetorics that intervene upon, perpetuate, and alter dominant discourse and representations of refugee subjectivity. In the review of literature, a brief history of resettlement discourse is discussed followed by an overview of postcolonial theory as it relates to humanitarian work, providing a theoretical foundation for the critical analysis of empowerment in refugee resettlement. The rhetorical ethnographic methods employed in this study are discussed in greater detail, before the analysis identifies ways in which empowerment rhetoric (1) articulates with neoliberalism, 2) endorses exclusionary representations of the American Dream, and 3) struggles against and amidst dominant interpretations of normative resettlement. Historically, the plight of refugees has resonated with deeply held American values, drawing comparisons to the European pilgrims who colonized North America while they escaped religious persecution. Beloved figures of the state such as Albert Einstein, Henry Kissinger, and Madeline Albright are retold as founders and supporters of resettlement institutions. The partnerships with state programs and non-governmental resettlement and aid organizations built a legacy of collaboration. Prior to World War II, social work services attempted to distinguish between immigrants and refugees, so as to demonstrate the “desirability for entry and fitness for integration” of those individuals who were fleeing conflict and not migrating by choice (Park, 2008, p. 776). Throughout the first half of the 21st century, discourse regarding refugees of Irish, German, and Scandinavian descent began reconciling what was previously constructed as undesirable bodies, transforming them into “Americans,” while excluding other nationalities (Park, 2008). Similarly, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">refugee resettlement today valorizes entrepreneurialism and economic independence as benchmarks of good citizenship. According to the US State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (2015), “the U.S. refugee resettlement program reflects the core values of the United States and our strong tradition of providing a safe haven for the oppressed” (p. 1). Social mobility and economic independence are American narratives that interpret and convey values reflected in the refugee resettlement programs. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Nguyen (2012) names “transnational multiculturalism” as conjoined forms of racial discourse predicated on ownership of the self as a condition for freedom and the representation of global imperial interests as neutral common goods (p. 142). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">Certain refugee bodies are not rendered sufficient citizens by the state and these standards are used as the basis of selective exclusion and inclusion</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (McKinnon, 2011).

Refugees still experience poverty despite the focus on their contribution to society and their ethic of hard work. They may be safe from imminent violence for the most part, but they are not free from the precarity of exclusion and dispossession. According to a US Department of Health and Human Services report (Halpern, 2008), 70 to 86 percent of refugees reported some degree of employment but still had relatively low family income ($21,000 to $23,000). Ray Bush (2007) concludes that resistance to imperial global capital has “not objected simply to the principles of globalization per se but to the kind of globalization that has emerged: a world where 20 percent of the richest people account for more than 85 percent of global consumption and where those consumption patterns attack the world’s environment, challenge any autonomous activity, and seek to universally spread commodity production” (p. 180). </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">Refugees are integrated into the economic order by emphasizing their primary role as consumers in the world’s largest economy. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">At the GRA, staff both participated in and altered these roles to meet culturally specific needs and achieve financial incentives.

De jure, or rightful, citizenship becomes contractualized and commodified under market fundamentalism, leading to a retreat of the social state and its attending protections and supports (Somers 2008). In Somers’s theoretical reconsideration of American citizenship, she argues that rights-based citizenship is premised on social inclusion, on “meaningful membership in civil society and political community—that confers recognition and rights” (Somers 2008, 118).

Social welfare policies, as neoliberal regulatory practice, have been analyzed for far-reaching and profound human consequences. Over 35 years after the passing of the Refugee Act, academic inquiries and government assessments of current resettlement practice indicate parallel outcomes. Some refugee scholars have called into question the predominance of fasttrack employment for refugees as a policy aim (see US Government Accountability Office 2011, 2012; Connolly 2013), the marketized management and incentivized funding structures (see Trudeau 2008; Erickson 2010), and decentralized resettlement programming (see Zetter, Griffiths, and Sigona 2005). This article helps synthesize a more particular argument about the work-focused, devolved, and marketized modes of policy and practice with refugees. Juxtaposing refugee policy with welfare policy suggests new insights and opens up new lines of theoretical and empirical inquiry on how the two policy arenas may inform one another. This policy discourse helps contour the theoretical underpinnings for resettlement practice and policy, while it locates refugee studies in a conversation with the broader scholarship about neoliberalism, social welfare, and citizenship.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000042"> </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000005"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Style13ptBold">The permutation’s aspirations are heavily augmented by neoliberal ideology surrounding citizenship </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000005"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Style13ptBold">Oliveri 15 </span><span class="pt-Style13ptBold-000034">[Federico Oliveri, “</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">Subverting neoliberal citizenship.

The Bossi-Fini law currently requires migrants to leave Italy if unemployed for more than a year, giving therefore enormous power to employers, who may prefer immigrant workers exactly because of their higher precarity. The same law allows migrants without valid permit to stay to be hold in so called Identification and Expulsion Centers (CIE) for up to 18 months, with the declared but largely unattended aim to return them to their country of departure. Under neoliberal governance of migration, irregularity is not an accident or a failure but is systematically produced by immigration policies: “irregularization” (Hiemstra 2010) and everyday “deportability” (De Genova 2002) reinforce the risk of severe labour exploitation, for regular and irregular migrants as well. The majority of migrants are required to go through a period of irregularity, including possible incarceration, during which time they are tested: only those who accept to live with no or few rights in precarious conditions will be admitted to the rank of the regulars (Santoro 2008; Conlon and Gill 2013).

In his Great Persuasion, he argues that the philosophically subtle followers of Hayek were displaced by the coarser libertarian followers of Friedman within the MPS in the 1970s, and thus, “Friedman created a social philosophy that was much less conflicted than those of the leading figures of the early Mont Pèlerin Society” (2012, p.177). No doubt there abided Hayek and Friedman factions in MPS in the later 20th century: how could there not be tension between neoclassical economists and the Hayekian image of the market? No doubt, likewise, the MPS also revised many of its doctrinal points over the course of the 1950s-1980s. However, there was nothing simple about Friedman’s precarious balancing act at the heart of the Neoliberal project, which never consisted of a reversion to the simple-minded libertarianism which Burgin portrays. The counterevidence comes in Friedman’s own private correspondence, such as a 1973 letter to Pat Buchanan: “We are talking at cross-purposes because of what I regard as the important necessity of keeping clearly separate the long-run ideal goal and the tactical steps that may be appropriate in moving towards it.”21</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">¶</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> This distinction did not merely consist of the trimming of the sails to render their political project more palatable to the masses; it consisted of living </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">a sequence of double truths</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">—one for the masses, another for battle-hardened insiders—that </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">grew organically out of the key political and epistemological positions innovated by the thought collective over the last sixty years.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> I have attempted to document the nature of these </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">“contradictions”</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> in detail elsewhere,22 so only summarize them briefly here</span><span class="pt-Emphasis">.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> The first is the MPS </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">broadcasting its putative great respect for freedom of thought and liberal openness, while exercising the strictest principles of exclusion and censorship when it came to sanctioned discourse</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> within the MPS; </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Friedman</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> even </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">joked to Hayek about the ironies of convening an organization that their own theories argued should not exist. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">The second contradiction is that </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">the thought collective praised the superiority of supposed “spontaneous order”, while prosecuting a highly regimented set of organizations to take power and impose their ideal structures of a market society</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">.

Apocalyptic time is the “time of the end of time,” the time of emergency, of the “state of exception” when the end is nigh and we can only prepare for it. There are at least four different versions of apocalyptism today: Christian fundamentalism, New Age spirituality, techno-digital post-humanism, and secular ecologism. Although they all share the basic notion that humanity is approaching a zero-point of radical transmutation, their respective ontologies differ radically: Techno-digital apocalyptism (of which Ray Kurzweil is the main representative) remains within the confines of scientific naturalism, and discerns in the evolution of human species the contours of our transformation into “post-humans” New Age spirituality gives this transmutation a further twist, interpreting it as the shift from one mode of “cosmic awareness” to another (usually a shift from the modern dualist-mechanistic stance to one of holistic immersion). Christian fundamentalists of course read the apocalypse in strictly biblical terms, that is, they search for (and find) in the contemporary world signs that the final battle between Christ and the Anti-Christ is imminent. Finally, secular ecologism shares the naturalist stance of post-humanism, but gives it a negative twist—what lies ahead, the “omega point” we are approaching, is not a progression to a higher “post-human” level, but the catastrophic self-destruction of humanity. Although Christian fundamentalist apocalyptism is considered the most ridiculous, and dangerous, in its content, it remains the version closest to a radical “millenarian” emancipatory logic. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">The task is thus to bring it into closer contact with secular ecologism, thereby conceiving the threat of annihilation as the chance for a radical emancipatory renewal. </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000001"> </span></p><h3 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading3"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000003">1 --- War </span></h3><h4 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading4"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">Capitalism drives militarism </span></h4><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">IR 2004</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000038"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000039">(International Review, “War without end in the Middle East: capitalism is the real culprit”, http://en.internationalism.org/ir/118_edito.html) </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">All the great leaders of the capitalist world invited us to commemorate, with them, the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy on 6th June 1944</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">.

The perspective of peace and prosperity announced by the dominant American power has long since disappeared, to give way to the nightmare of a society tearing itself apart across the world, at the risk of dragging all humanity down to its ruin. Although this aspect of a “war of each against all” was already a determining feature of the first Gulf War in 1991, it remained hidden inasmuch as the USA succeeded in rallying the other great powers behind its leadership thanks to its remaining authority. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">The war of each against all, the defence by each power of its own imperialist interests to the detriment of its rivals, appeared more explicitly in the conflicts in Rwanda, ex-Yugoslavia, and Zaire. And the new millennium has seen a further intensification of these conflicts. After the 9/11 attack, the United States solemnly announced that they would make war on terrorism, free Afghanistan from the backward Taliban, and bring democracy and prosperity to Iraq. Today, the result is an increasingly bloody instability spreading not only to Iraq but to the rest of the region as well.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> What is new, is that the planet's greatest military power is beginning to lose its grip on the situation. The triumphant images of US troops entering Baghdad and overturning Saddam's statue, have been succeeded by daily killings that demonstrate the Americans' inability to stabilise the situation in which the population is subjected to appalling living conditions. The bitter struggle between local warlords, more or less tied to different world or regional powers, already dominates Iraq and Afghanistan and is now beginning to spread to Saudi Arabia, with a wave of attacks on foreigners, oil installations, and the government. Instability in Saudi Arabia threatens the world's main source of oil (25% of proven world reserves), and creates a further risk for an already unstable world economic situation: that of an explosion in oil prices, already standing (as we write) at over $40 / barrel. The dynamic is such that even the great powers are no longer able to imprint their orientation on society, still less to offer it the slightest perspective. The heart of Europe has not been spared the eruption of chaos in its midst, with the bomb attacks in Madrid on 11th March 2004. All this is an expression of “</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000023">the world’s entry into a period of unprecedented instability</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">” (Introduction to the “Theses on Decomposition”, 1990, in </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000023">International Review</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> n°107), which is accelerating today. In fact, the 1991 Gulf War already demonstrated that “</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000023">faced with the tendency towards generalised chaos specific to the period of decomposition, and which has been considerably accelerated by the collapse of the Eastern bloc, there is no other way out for capitalism, in its attempts to hold together a disintegrating body, than to impose on society the iron straitjacket of military force.

Is the Bush administration the fundamental cause of the disaster in Iraq? The anti-Bush demonstrators, and all the honeyed words to the UN from powers like France and Germany, even the cries of despair from some fractions of the bourgeoisie in the United States, all propose to reverse this tendency and return to a stable world thanks to governments that would be less greedy and cynical, more generous and intelligent. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">The bourgeoisie would indeed like to make us believe that peace and stability depend on those who rule us.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> In this sense, the preferred argument for the various national bourgeoisies who opposed the war in Iraq – because it went against their interests – is to say that if only Bush had respected “international law”, if he had respected the legitimacy of the UN, then Iraq would not have become the bloody quagmire that it is today, and the United States would not be in the mess it is in. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">Although the American bourgeoisie was generally in favour of the war, more and more voices are being raised to say that the present situation is the result of the incompetence of Bush and his administration</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, who have proven unable to stabilise Iraq. In fact, both these arguments are false. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">For the ruling class, they are born of a need to deceive, and to deceive themselves. Today's spreading anarchic instability is a pure product of capitalism's historic situation today. It has nothing to do with any one person's greater or lesser competence or personality. In reality: “As regards the international policy of the USA, the widespread use of armed force has not only been one of its methods for a long time, but is now the main instrument in the defence of its imperialist interests, as the ICC has shown since 1990, even before the Gulf war. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000023">The USA is faced with a world dominated by "every man for himself", where its former vassals are trying to withdraw as much as possible from the tight grip of the world cop, which they had to put up with as long as the threat from the rival bloc existed. In this situation, the only decisive way the US</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000023">can impose its authority is to resort to the area in which they have a crushing superiority over all other states: military force. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">But in doing so, the US is caught in a contradiction: – on the one hand, if it gives up using or extending the use of its military superiority, this will only encourage the countries contesting its authority to contest even more; – on the other hand, when it does use brute force, even, and especially when this momentarily obliges its opponents to rein in their ambitions towards independence, this only pushes the latter to seize on the least occasion to get their revenge and squirm away from America's grasp</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">” (“Resolution on the international situation at the 12th ICC Congress”, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000023">International Review</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> n°90, 1997). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">To lay the responsibility for war at the door of this or that head of state's incompetence, allows the ruling class to hide the reality, to hide the appalling responsibility of capitalism and with it the whole ruling class world wide</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">This logic makes it possible to absolve the system for its crimes by laying the blame on its scapegoats:</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> Hitler's madness was responsible for World War II; Bush's incompetence is responsible for the war in Iraq and its attendant horrors. In reality, in each case the man, his temperament and his specificities, corresponds to the demands of the ruling class that put him in power. Both have done nothing other than apply the policies required by their class, in defence of their class interests. Hitler received the support of the whole German ruling class because he showed himself capable of preparing the war rendered inevitable by the crisis of capitalism and the defeat of the revolutionary wave that had followed October 1917. The German rearmament programme of the 1930s, followed by the World War against the USSR and the other Allies, was both inevitable, given the situation of Germany after the Versailles Treaty of 1919, and doomed to failure. It was, in this sense, profoundly irrational. Hitler's unbalanced mentality – or rather, the fact that such a mentality could become head of state – was nothing other than an expression of the irrationality of the war that the German bourgeoisie was preparing to wage. The same is true for Bush and his administration. They are, today, carrying out the only possible policy, from a capitalist standpoint, to defend US imperialist interests and world leadership: war, and a descent into militarism. The incompetence of the Bush administration, notably the influence within it of the neo-con warmongering faction represented by Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, its inability to find a long-term vision on which to base its action, are expressions of the fact that the White House's foreign policy is both the only one possible, and doomed to failure. The fact that Colin Powell, also a member of the administration and one who knows what war is about, had his warnings about the lack of preparation for the conflict and its aftermath ignored, is further confirmation of this tendency to irrationality. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">The whole US bourgeoisie defends a militarist policy because it is the only one possible</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. Indeed, the disagreements within the US ruling class, faced with the catastrophe that the situation in Iraq represents for the credibility and world leadership of the United States, are purely of a tactical order, but in no sense a condemnation of the war itself. So true is this, that John Kerry, Democratic candidate at the next presidential elections, has no alternative policy to propose other than reinforcing the American troops already in Iraq. If the choice and success of government policy depended solely on the capacities of those in power, how could we explain the fact that the imperialist policy of Ronald Reagan – no less intellectually disadvantaged than Bush – encountered such success against Russian imperialism, especially in Afghanistan? The reason is to be found in the different underlying conditions: because, under Reagan, the USA was at the head of one of two rival imperialist blocs that dominated the world, and as a result enjoyed a far greater authority over the other members of its bloc. As for the “peace party” over Iraq, the attitude of Chirac or Schröder has nothing to do with their greater human or political qualities compared with Bush, and everything to do with the fact that war in Iraq directly threatened their own imperialist interests. For Germany, the fact that the USA has taken position in the region is an obstacle to its own advance into the region, which has always been a traditional target of German imperialism. France has been stripped of the influence it had in Iraq on the basis of its support for Saddam Hussein. It is not the capacities of those with influence in the bourgeois state, still less their good or ill will, that will put an end to war, but the class struggle</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">. The policy of the bourgeoisie is solely and implacably determined, in every country, by the defence of the national capital. To this end, it puts in power those who seem best able to meet its requirements. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">And if Kerry replaces Bush as president, this will be to breath new life into a policy which will remain essentially the same. Changing governments will not put an end to war: only destroying capitalism can do that. Neither the planned (as we write) transfer of sovereignty to an Iraqi government, nor the unanimous UN vote in favour of this transfer, herald any greater stability in the future. No more than the project for a “Greater Middle East”. Still less the grand celebrations of the D-Day landings and all the declarations of good intentions that accompanied them. Is Europe an antidote to world disorder? Could Europe be an antidote to this disorder, or at least limit its extent? At the entry of the new member countries to the European Union, on 1st May 2004, and during the last European elections, France and Germany presented the construction of Europe as a factor for peace and stability in the world. If Europe could unite, this would be a guarantee of peace, so we are told. This is a lie. Supposing that all the states of Europe managed to march in step, a European bloc would also be a factor of world conflict, because it would be a rival to the United States. The proposed European constitution in fact expresses, in veiled terms, the ambition of certain states to use the European Union in order to play a role on the world imperialist arena: “</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000023">Member States shall actively and unreservedly support the Union's common foreign and security policy in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity and shall comply with the acts adopted by the Union in this area. They shall refrain from action contrary to the Union's interests or likely to impair its effectiveness</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">” (Article 15-2 of the Draft Treaty</span><a id="_ftnref1" class="pt-000048"></a><a href="http://en.internationalism.org/ir/118_edito.html"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000049" /><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000049" /><span class="pt-Hyperlink-000014">[1]</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000049" /></a><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">). Such an orientation can only be a threat to America's leadership, and this is why the US is constantly putting spanners in the works of the construction of any kind of European unity, for example by supporting the Turkish candidature for membership of the Union. This being said, European unity only exists at the level of propaganda. To have an idea of the absurdity of the notion of a “European bloc”, we need only look at the reality of the European Union: the European budget is a puny 4% of European GNP, most of which is destined not for military spending but for the Common Agricultural Policy; there is no military force under European command capable of vying with NATO or the American armed forces. Nor does the EU include a military super-power able to impose its will on the other members (one expression of this is the cacophony that reigns in the negotiations for the adoption of the new constitution).</span><a id="_ftnref2" class="pt-000048"></a><a href="http://en.internationalism.org/ir/118_edito.html"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000049" /><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000049" /><span class="pt-Hyperlink-000014">[2]</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000049" /></a><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> To cap it all, the policy of one of the main members of the Union, Britain, is aimed precisely (as it has been for the last 400 years) at maintaining divisions amongst the other European powers, its “allies” within the EU. In these circumstances, any European alliance can never be anything but a temporary and necessarily unstable agreement. The wars in Yugoslavia and Iraq have highlighted the disintegration of Europe's political unity as soon as the imperialist interests of its various member bourgeoisies are at stake. If there is currently a tendency for countries like Spain or Poland, or others in Central Europe, to turn towards Germany, then this can only be limited in time, as indeed are the different episodes in the on-off love affair between France and Germany. Whether the tendency of the moment is towards political union or towards open discord, the underlying exacerbation of tensions between the European Union's member states cannot be overcome. In the context of the bankruptcy of capitalism and the decomposition of bourgeois society, reality demonstrates that the only possible policy for each major power is to try to create difficulties for its rivals in order to gain the advantage for itself. This is the law of capitalism. The growing, spreading anarchy and instability are not a specificity of this or that backward or exotic region: they are the product of capitalism in its present, irreversible phase of decomposition. And since capitalism dominates the planet, then it is the whole planet which is increasingly subject to chaos. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">What perspective is there for humanity's future? Only the world proletariat bears a perspective in itself, since it is not only the exploited class, but above all the revolutionary class in this society: in other words, the class which bears in itself other social relations free of exploitation, war, and poverty. Condensing within itself every misery, every injustice, and every exploitation, it potentially wields the force to overthrow capitalism and build a truly communist society.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> But if the working class is to live up to what history demands of it, then it must understand that war is a product of bankrupt capitalism; that the bourgeoisie is a cynical and deceitful class of exploiters, whose greatest fear is that the proletariat should see reality as it is, and not as it is presented by the exploiters. Only the development of the class struggle, for the defence of the workers' living conditions and, ultimately, the overthrow of capitalism, will allow the proletariat to hold back the bloody hand of the bourgeoisie. Let us remember that it was the class struggle of the workers of the early 20th century that put an end to World War I. The proletariat has a great historical responsibility before it. The development of its consciousness of what is at stake, and of its unity in struggle, will determine its ability to live up to this responsibility. The future of all humanity depends on it.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000050"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000003">1 --- Inequality</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000051"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">Resisting the systemic violence of capitalism is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees social exclusion on a global scale </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">Zizek &amp; Daly 4</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000038"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000039">(Slavoj, senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London, and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 14-16)</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000052">For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of postmodern protocol and recognize that</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">our ethico-political responsibility is to confront the constitutive violence of </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">today’s global</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011"> capitalism and its obscene naturalization / anonymization of the millions </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">who are</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011"> subjugated by it </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">throughout the world. Against the standardized positions of postmodern culture – with all its pieties concerning ‘multiculturalist’ etiquette – Zizek is arguing for a politics that might be called ‘radically incorrect’ in the sense that it break with these types of positions 7 and focuses instead on the very organizing principles of today’s social reality: the principles of global liberal capitalism. This requires some care and subtlety. For far too long, Marxism has been bedeviled by an almost fetishistic economism that has tended towards political morbidity. With the likes of Hilferding and Gramsci, and more recently Laclau and Mouffee, crucial theoretical advances have been made that enable the transcendence of all forms of economism. In this new context, however, Zizek argues that the problem that now presents itself is almost that of the opposite fetish. That is to say, the prohibitive anxieties surrounding the taboo of economism can function as a way of not engaging with economic reality and as a way of implicitly accepting the latter as a basic horizon of existence. In an ironic Freudian-Lacanian twist, the fear of economism can end up reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary capitalism (i.e. the initial prohibition conjures up the very thing it fears). This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde return to economism. Zizek’s point is rather that in rejecting economism we should not lose sight of the systemic power of capital in shaping the lives and destinies of humanity and our very sense of the possible. In particular we should not overlook Marx’s central insight that in order to create a universal global system</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011"> the forces of capitalism seek to conceal the politico-discursive violence of its construction through a kind of gentrification of that system.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000052">What is persistently denied by neo-liberals such as Rorty (1989) and Fukuyama (1992) is that </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">the gentrification of global liberal capitalism</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000052"> is one whose ‘universalism’ fundamentally </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">reproduces and depends upon a disavowed violence that excludes vast sectors of the world’s populations.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000052"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">In this way, neo-liberal ideology attempts to naturalize capitalism by presenting its outcomes of winning and losing as if they were simply a matter of chance and sound judgment in a neutral market place.

La Vía Campesina, a global peasant-farmer organization, is promoting new forms of ecological agriculture, as is Brazil’s MST (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra), as are Cuba and Venezuela.

It will become increasingly clear that the distribution of land as well as food, health care, housing, etc. should be based on fulfilling human needs and not market forces. This is, of course, easier said than done. But it means making economic decisions through democratic processes occurring at local, regional, and multiregional levels. We must face such issues as: (1) How can we supply everyone with basic human needs of food, water, shelter, clothing, health care, educational and cultural opportunities? (2) How much of the economic production should be consumed and how much invested? and (3) How should the investments be directed?

To the great chagrin of reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood … In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations … National one-sidedness and narrow- mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literature.” Karl Marx and Frederick Engels had the answer to the questions the EU ministers will be asking: You cannot create fenced fortresses in the age of global production and consumption of both goods and ideas.

Attacks by a terrorist group on a Pakistani military base, at Kamra, which is believed to house nuclear weapons in some form, have been referenced in connection with such security concerns (Nelson and Hussain, 2012). However, the Kamra base contained US fighter planes, including F-16s, used to bomb Taliban bases in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, so the planes, not nuclear weapons, were the likely target of the terrorists, and in any case the mission was a failure. Moreover, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">Pakistan is not about to collapse, and the Pakistanis are known to have received </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">major international assistance</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> in technologies for protecting their weapons from unauthorized use, store them in somewhat disassembled fashion at multiple locations, and have a </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">sophisticated nuclear security structure</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> in place</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (see Gregory, 2013; Khan, 2012).</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">However, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">the weapons are assembled at times of high tension in the region, and, to keep a degree of uncertainty in their location, they are moved from place to place, making them more vulnerable to seizure at such times</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Goldberg and Ambinder, 2011).

This is not a particularly realistic scenario, but it’s also not a reason to conclude that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal is of no concern. It is, not only because of an internal threat, but especially because it raises the possibility of nuclear war with India. For this and other reasons, intelligence agencies in multiple countries spend considerable resources tracking the Pakistani nuclear situation to reduce the likelihood of surprises. But any consideration of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal does bring home (once again) the folly of US policy in the 1980s, when stopping the Pakistani nuclear program was put on a back burner in order to prosecute the Cold War against the Soviets in Afghanistan (which ultimately led to the establishment of Al Qaeda). Some of the loudest voices expressing concern about nuclear terrorism belong to former senior government officials who supported US assistance to the mujahideen and the accompanying diminution of US opposition to Pakistan’s nuclear activities.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Acquiring nukes</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> as a gift.

The probability of such a yield (and its size) would depend on the geometry of the HEU components and the amount of material. More likely than a substantial nuclear explosion from such a scenario would be a criticality accident that would release an intense burst of radiation, killing persons in the immediate vicinity, or (even less likely) a low-yield nuclear “fizzle” that could be quite damaging locally (like a large TNT explosion) but also carry a psychological effect because of its nuclear dimension.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">In any case, since the critical mass of a bare metal perfect sphere of pure U-235 is approximately 56 kilograms, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">stealing that much highly enriched material</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (and getting away without detection, an armed fight, or a criticality accident) </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">is </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">a major problem</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> for any thief and one significantly greater than the stealing of small amounts of HEU and lower-enriched material that has been reported from time to time over the past two decades</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, mostly from former Soviet sites that have since had their security greatly strengthened.

Reed discusses the feasibility of terrorists building a low-yield, gun-type fission weapon, but admittedly avoids the issue of whether the terrorists would likely have the technical ability to carry feasibility to realization and whether the terrorists are likely to be successful in stealing the needed material and hiding their project as it proceeds (Reed, 2014). But this is the crux of the nuclear terrorism issue. There is no argument about feasibility, which has been accepted for decades, even for plutonium-based weapons, ever since Ted Taylor first raised it in the early 1970s5 and a Senate subcommittee held hearings in the late 1970s on a weapon design created by a Harvard dropout from information he obtained from the public section of the Los Alamos National Laboratory library (Fialka, 1978). Likewise, no one can deny the terrible consequences of a nuclear explosion. The question is the level of risk, and what steps are acceptable in a democracy for reducing it.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Although the attention in the literature given to nuclear terrorism scenarios involving HEU would suggest major attempts to obtain such material by terrorist groups, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">there is only one known case of a major theft of HEU</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. It involves a US government contractor processing HEU for the US Navy in Apollo, Pennsylvania in the 1970s at a time when security and materials accounting were extremely lax. The theft was almost surely carried out by agents of the Israeli government with the probable involvement of a person or persons working for the contractor, not a sub-national terrorist group intent on making its own weapons (Gilinsky and Mattson, 2010). </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The circumstances under which this theft occurred were unique, and there was significant information about the contractor’s relationship to Israel that should have rung alarm bells and would do so today</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. Although it involved a government and not a sub-national group, the theft underscores the importance of security and accounting of nuclear materials, especially because the technical requirements for making an HEU weapon are less daunting than for a plutonium weapon, and the probability of success by a terrorist group, though low, is certainly greater than zero.

Some extreme projections suggest that if the cost can be cut to roughly triple the cost of fuel and oxidizer (meaning, the spacecraft concerned will be both largely reusable and very cheap) then we might even get as low as $165/kilogram to the lunar surface. At that price, sending a 100Kg astronaut to Moon Base One looks as if it ought to cost not much more than a first-class return air fare from the UK to New Zealand ... except that such a price estimate is hogwash. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">We primates have certain failure modes, and one of them that must not be underestimated is our tendency to </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">irreversibly malfunction</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> when exposed to climactic extremes of temperature, pressure, and partial pressure of oxygen. While the amount of oxygen, water, and food a human consumes per day doesn't sound all that serious — it probably totals roughly ten kilograms, if you economize and recycle the washing-up water — the amount of parasitic weight you need to keep the monkey from blowing out is measured in tons. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">A Russian Orlan-M space suit (which, some would say, is better than anything NASA has come up with over the years — take heed of the pre-breathe time requirements!) weighs 112 kilograms, which pretty much puts a floor on our infrastructure requirements. An actual habitat would need to mass a whole lot more. Even at $165/kilogram, that's going to add up to a very hefty excess baggage charge on that notional first class air fare to New Zealand — and I think the $165/kg figure is in any case highly unrealistic; even the authors of the article I cited thought $2000/kg was a bit more reasonable. Whichever way you cut it,</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">sending a single tourist to the moon is going to cost</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">not less than $50,000 — and a more realistic figure, for a mature reusable, cheap, rocket-based lunar transport cycle is more like </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">$1M. And that's before you factor in the price of bringing them back ... </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">The moon is about 1.3 light seconds away. If we want to go panning the (metaphorical) rivers for gold, we'd do better to send teleoperator-controlled robots; it's close enough that we can control them directly, and far enough away that the cost of transporting food and creature comforts for human explorers is astronomical. There probably are niches for human workers on a moon base, but only until our robot technologies are somewhat more mature than they are today; Mission Control would be a lot happier with a pair of hands and a high-def camera that doesn't talk back and doesn't need to go to the toilet or take naps.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">When we look at the rest of the solar system, the picture is even bleaker. Mars is ... </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">well, the phrase "tourist resort" springs to mind, and is promptly filed in the same corner as</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> "Gobi desert</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">". As Bruce Sterling has puts it: "I'll believe in people settling Mars at about the same time I see people settling the Gobi Desert. The Gobi Desert is about a thousand times as hospitable as Mars and five hundred times cheaper and easier to reach. Nobody ever writes "Gobi Desert Opera" because, well, it's just kind of plonkingly obvious that there's no good reason to go there and live. It's ugly, it's inhospitable and there's no way to make it pay. Mars is just the same, really. We just romanticize it because it's so hard to reach." In other words, going there to explore is fine and dandy — our robots are all over it already.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">But as a desirable residential neighbourhood it has some shortcomings, starting with the slight </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">lack of breathable air</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> and the </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">sub-Antarctic</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> nighttime </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">temperatures</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> and the </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">Mach</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> 0</span><span class="pt-Emphasis">.5</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> dust storms, and working down from there.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Actually, there probably is a good reason for sending human explorers to Mars. And that's the distance: at up to 30 minutes, the speed of light delay means that remote control of robots on the Martian surface is extremely tedious. Either we need autonomous roots that can be assigned tasks and carry them out without direct human supervision, or we need astronauts in orbit or on the ground to boss the robot work gangs around. On the other hand, Mars is a good way further away than the moon, and has a deeper gravity well. All of which drive up the cost per kilogram delivered to the Martian surface. Maybe FedEx could cut it as low as $20,000 per kilogram, but I'm not holding my breath. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">Let me repeat myself: </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">we are not going there with rockets</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">. At least, not the conventional kind — and while there may be a role for nuclear propulsion in deep space, in general there's a trade-off between instantaneous thrust and efficiency; the more efficient your motor, the lower the actual thrust it provides. Some technologies such as the variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket show a good degree of flexibility, but in general they're not suitable for getting us from Earth's surface into orbit — they're only useful for trucking things around from low earth orbit on out. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Again, as with interstellar colonization, there are other options. Space elevators, if we build them, will invalidate a lot of what I just said. Some analyses of the energy costs of space elevators suggest that a marginal cost of $350/kilogram to geosynchronous orbit should be achievable without waving any magic wands (other than the enormous practical materials and structural engineering problems of building the thing in the first place). So we probably can look forward to zero-gee vacations in orbit, at a price. And space elevators are attractive because they're a scalable technology; you can use one to haul into space the material to build more. So, long term, space elevators may give us not-unreasonably priced access to space, including jaunts to the lunar surface for a price equivalent to less than $100,000 in today's money. At which point, settlement would begin to look economically feasible, except ...</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">We're human beings. We evolved to flourish in a </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">very specific environment</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> that covers perhaps 10% of our home planet's surface area. (</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Earth is 70% ocean, and while we can survive, with assistance, in extremely inhospitable terrain, be it arctic or desert or mountain, we aren't well-adapted to thriving there.)</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">Space itself is a </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">very poor environment</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> for humans to live in.

And finally, there's the travel time. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Two and a half years to Jupiter system; six months to Mars. Now, these problems are subject to a variety of approaches — including medical ones: does it matter if cosmic radiation causes long-term cumulative radiation exposure leading to cancers if we have advanced side-effect-free cancer treatments? Better still, if hydrogen sulphide-induced hibernation turns out to be a practical technique in human beings, we may be able to sleep through the trip. But even so, when you get down to it,</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">there's not really any economically viable activity on the horizon for people to engage in that would require them to settle on a planet or asteroid and live there for the rest of their lives.In general, when we need to extract resources from a hostile environment we tend to build infrastructure to exploit them (such as oil platforms) but we don't exactly scurry to move our families there</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. Rather, crews go out to work a long shift, then return home to take their leave. After all, there's no there there — just a howling wilderness of north Atlantic gales and frigid water that will kill you within five minutes of exposure. And that, I submit, is the closest metaphor we'll find for interplanetary colonization. Most of the heavy lifting more than a million kilometres from Earth will be done by robots, overseen by human supervisors who will be itching to get home and spend their hardship pay. And closer to home, the commercialization of space will be incremental and slow, driven by our increasing dependence on near-earth space for communications, positioning, weather forecasting, and (still in its embryonic stages) tourism.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">But the domed city on Mars is going to have to </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">wait for a magic wand</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> or two to do something about the climate, or reinvent a kind of human being who can thrive in an airless, inhospitable environment.</span></p><h4 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading4"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036">energy </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">and</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036"> distance </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">block </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036">deep space</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004"> colonization</span></h4><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000005"><span class="pt-Style13ptBold">Stross 7</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> (Charlie, gradutated from the University of Bradford, degrees in pharmacy and computer science, worked as a technical author, a freelance journalist, a programmer and a pharmacist at different times, author of six Hugo-nominated novels and winner of the 2005 and 2010 Hugo awards for best novella.

(You may want to get hold of a ruler to follow through with this one.) The solar system is conveniently small. Neptune, the outermost planet in our solar system, orbits the sun at a distance of almost exactly 30AU, or 30 centimetres — one foot (in imperial units). Giant Jupiter is 5.46 AU out from the sun, almost exactly two inches (in old money). We've sent space probes to Jupiter; they take two and a half years to get there if we send them on a straight Hohmann transfer orbit, but we can get there a bit faster using some fancy orbital mechanics. Neptune is still a stretch — only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, has made it out there so far. Its journey time was 12 years, and it wasn't stopping. (It's now on its way out into interstellar space, having passed the heliopause some years ago.) The Kuiper belt, domain of icy wandering dwarf planets like Pluto and Eris, extends perhaps another 30AU, before merging into the much more tenuous Hills cloud and Oort cloud, domain of loosely coupled long-period comets. Now for the first scale shock: using our handy metaphor the Kuiper belt is perhaps a metre in diameter. The Oort cloud, in contrast, is as much as 50,000 AU in radius — its outer edge lies half a kilometre away. Got that? Our planetary solar system is 30 centimetres, roughly a foot, in radius. But to get to the edge of the Oort cloud, you have to go half a kilometre, roughly a third of a mile. Next on our tour is Proxima Centauri, our nearest star. (There might be a brown dwarf or two lurking unseen in the icy depths beyond the Oort cloud, but if we've spotted one, I'm unaware of it.) Proxima Centauri is 4.22 light years away.A light year is 63.2 x 103 AU, or 9.46 x 1012 Km. So Proxima Centauri, at 267,000 AU, is just under two and a third kilometres, or two miles (in old money) away from us. But Proxima Centauri is a poor choice, if we're looking for habitable real estate. While exoplanets are apparently common as muck, terrestrial planets are harder to find; Gliese 581c, the first such to be detected (and it looks like a pretty weird one, at that), is roughly 20.4 light years away, or using our metaphor, about ten miles. Try to get a handle on this:</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">it takes us 2-5 years to travel two inches.

What do I mean by outrageous amounts of cheap energy? Let's postulate that in the future, it will be possible to wave a magic wand and construct a camping kit that encapsulates all the necessary technologies and information to rebuild a human civilization capable of eventually sending out interstellar colonization missions — a bunch of self-replicating, self-repairing robotic hardware, and a downloadable copy of the sum total of human knowledge to date. Let's also be generous and throw in a closed-circuit life support system capable of keeping a human occupant alive indefinitely, for many years at a stretch, with zero failures and losses, and capable where necessary of providing medical intervention. Let's throw in a willing astronaut (the fool!) and stick them inside this assembly. It's going to be pretty boring in there, but I think we can conceive of our minimal manned interstellar mission as being about the size and mass of a Mercury capsule. And I'm going to nail a target to the barn door and call it 2000kg in total. (Of course we can cut corners, but I've already invoked self-replicating robotic factories and closed-cycle life support systems, and those are close enough to magic wands as it is. I'm going to deliberately ignore more speculative technologies such as starwisps, mind transfer, or AIs sufficiently powerful to operate autonomously — although I used them shamelessly in my novel Accelerando. What I'm trying to do here is come up with a useful metaphor for the energy budget realistically required for interstellar flight.) Incidentally, a probe massing 1-2 tons with an astronaut on top is a bit implausible, but a 1-2 ton probe could conceivably carry enough robotic instrumentation to do useful research, plus a laser powerful enough to punch a signal home, and maybe even that shrink-wrapped military/industrial complex in a tin can that would allow it to build something useful at the other end. Anything much smaller, though, isn't going to be able to transmit its findings to us — at least, not without some breakthroughs in communication technology that haven't shown up so far. Now, let's say we want to deliver our canned monkey to Proxima Centauri within its own lifetime. We're sending them on a one-way trip, so a 42 year flight time isn't unreasonable. (Their job is to supervise the machinery as it unpacks itself and begins to brew up a bunch of new colonists using an artificial uterus. Okay?) This means they need to achieve a mean cruise speed of 10% of the speed of light. They then need to decelerate at the other end. At 10% of c relativistic effects are minor — there's going to be time dilation, but it'll be on the order of hours or days over the duration of the 42-year voyage. So we need to accelerate our astronaut to 30,000,000 metres per second, and decelerate them at the other end. Cheating and using Newton's laws of motion, the kinetic energy acquired by acceleration is 9 x 1017 Joules, so we can call it 2 x 1018 Joules in round numbers for the entire trip. NB: This assumes that the propulsion system in use is 100% efficient at converting energy into momentum, that there are no losses from friction with the interstellar medium, and that the propulsion source is external — that is, there's no need to take reaction mass along en route. So this is a lower bound on the energy cost of transporting our Mercury-capsule sized expedition to Proxima Centauri in less than a lifetime. To put this figure in perspective, the total conversion of one kilogram of mass into energy yields 9 x 1016 Joules. (Which one of my sources informs me, is about equivalent to 21.6 megatons in thermonuclear explosive yield). So we require the equivalent energy output to 400 megatons of nuclear armageddon in order to move a capsule of about the gross weight of a fully loaded Volvo V70 automobile to Proxima Centauri in less than a human lifetime. That's the same as the yield of the entire US Minuteman III ICBM force. For a less explosive reference point, our entire planetary economy runs on roughly 4 terawatts of electricity (4 x 1012 watts). So </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">it would take our </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">total planetary electricity</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">production</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">for</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">a period of half a million seconds — roughly </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">5 days — to supply the necessary</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">va-va-</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">voom. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">But to bring this back to earth with a bump, let me just remind you that </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">this probe is </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Emphasis">so implausibly efficient </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">that it's veering back into</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Emphasis"> "magic wand" territory</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. I've tap-danced past a 100% efficient power transmission system capable of operating across interstellar distances with pinpoint precision and no conversion losses, and that allows the spacecraft on the receiving end to convert power directly into momentum. This is not exactly like any power transmission system that anyone's built to this date, and I'm not sure I can see where it's coming from. Our one astronaut, 10% of c mission approximates well to an unmanned flight, but what about longer-term expeditions? Generation ships are a staple of SF; they're slow (probably under 1% of c) and they carry a self-sufficient city-state.</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The crew</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">who set off</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">won't live to see their destination (</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">the flight time to Proxima Centauri at 1% of c is about 420 years), but the vague hope is that someone will. Leaving aside our lack of a proven track record at building social institutions that are stable across time periods greatly in excess of a human lifespan, using a generation ship probably doesn't do much for our energy budget problem either.</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">A society of human beings are likely to need more space and raw material to do stuff with while in flight; sticking a solitary explorer in a tin can for forty-something years is merely cruel and unusual, but doing it to an entire city for several centuries probably qualifies as a crime against humanity.</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">We therefore need to relax the mass constraint. Assuming the same super-efficient life support as our solitary explorer, we might postulate that each colonist requires ten tons of structural mass to move around in. (About the same as a large trailer home. For life.) We've cut the peak velocity by an order of magnitude, but we've increased the payload requirement by an order of magnitude per passenger — and we need enough passengers to make a stable society fly. I'd guess a sensible lower number would be on the order of 200 people, the size of a prehistoric primate troupe. (Genetic diversity? I'm going to assume we can hand-wave around that by packing some deep-frozen sperm and ova, or frozen embryos, for later reuse.) By the time we work up to a minimal generation ship (and how minimal can we get, confining 200 human beings in an object weighing aout 2000 tons, for roughly the same period of time that has elapsed since the Plymouth colony landed in what was later to become Massachusetts?) we're actually requiring much more energy than our solitary high-speed explorer.

The question of how we might interact with alien biologies is an order of magnitude bigger and more complex than the question of how we might get there — and the preliminary outlook is rather forbidding.)

What the moment seems to call for is a sober step back</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> and — borrowing from Jane McAlevey — implementation of a “stress test” (McAlevey prefers the term “structure test”). Let’s test ourselves. Do the commitments and capacities exist to establish a loose but relatively coherent socialist current across the country? If this can’t be done, then bravely announcing the formation of a new party won’t go anywhere. The institutional essence of trying to create such a current/tendency has often been discussed and this familiar ground can be quickly summarized: Based on recruitment from the many activists mobilized by the Sanders campaign (or past socialist legacies in the case of Canada), </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">socialist groupings would be formed in multiple centers. Each would develop a democratic structure, raise funds, and in terms of engagement determine which movements and struggles to prioritize. The groups would develop an infrastructure</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> for communication, internal discussion/debate, and public forums. They would eventually hire part-time or full-time organizers, make links with other regions, and develop what Greg Albo calls</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">a “political ecology of protest”</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> — that is, frame the protests within a larger political context. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">Progressive candidates would be supported for a miscellany of local offices to build alliances, develop administrative skills within the movement, and provide a base for local experiments in alternative ways to address economic, environmental, and cultural needs. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Speakers from abroad could be brought in for national tours reporting on related experiments elsewhere. National conferences would be held, common national campaigns chosen to build some practical unity. Debates would naturally evolve over whether the time seems opportune to give birth to a new party with its greater discipline and eventual electoral ambitions, or whether further preliminary steps remain necessary. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Underlying these institutional tasks would be a number of general political tasks</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. First, </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">constantly hammering capitalism as an undemocratic social system that cannot meet popular needs</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, cannot meet human potentials, and cannot avoid despoiling the planet. Second, </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">insisting that if we are to do more than complain, we need to build an institutional capacity</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> with some hope of matching capitalism’s power; we need to move to deep organizing. Third, that at this particular moment </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">what is especially crucial is to organize ourselves to make the socialist idea relevant once mor</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">e — that is, to both create a new generation of intellectual organizers committed to socialism and through popular education contribute to placing socialism on the agenda again. Fourth, </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">active engagement in existing union and movement struggles is elemental. Absent such engagement we cannot possibly grasp the lay of the land, learn to deal with the inevitability of compromises, expand our base, or act constructively</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. Within such struggles a key challenge is to overcome the sense that socialist perspectives are distant and impractical ideals and demonstrate that they matter now — that they can contribute in practical terms to developing and carrying out union and movement strategies. Of special importance here are interventions in a number of debates that have stymied and divided the broad left. One is the centrality of the working class and unions. Much of the Left reserves its enthusiasm for the social movements while denigrating unions. But if the working class cannot be organized as an exemplary democratic social force, then social transformation is likewise impossible. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">While social movements are critical to social change, their ability to build the kind of sustained social power that might lead a challenge to capitalism has historically been disappointingly limited. Moreover, social movements remain dependent on the organizational capacities, independent resources and leverage of the working class. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Yet there has always been the question of where unions, with their sectional roles as representatives of particular groups of workers, fit into a struggle beyond capitalism. Today, there is no avoiding the most fundamental questions about the capacity of existing unions to play a role in social transformation. Is union renewal and radicalization possible? And especially critical to the place of a socialist current, is this possible without the intervention of socialists committed to that reinvention of unions? A related and especially fraught controversy revolves around the relationship between class and identity. The US election has amplified these divisions. It is not news that there are nativist and racist attitudes within the white US working class. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">But there is a strong case to be made at this point — as more information comes out we can be more definitive — that the deciding factor in the key Midwest states was not the white working class’s enthusiasm for Trump’s xenophobia and misogyny but the built-up anger against an establishment that had for so long ignored their class concerns. The increase in the numbers that abstained from voting for Clinton (or Trump) far exceeded those who switched to Trump. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">This does not excuse the apparent toleration of Trump’s racism and sexism but it does mean that the appeal of Trump among white voters should not be exaggerated</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">Any attempt to fight the expected direction of the Trump presidency can’t start by blaming the white working class for Trump’s victory but must take the frustrations of the white working class seriously </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Emphasis">and win them to its side. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">In this context, class politics is not a stand-in for setting aside the injustices of racism but rather a reminder that categories abstracted from class — like “white,” “black,” and “Latino” — obscure the imbalances in power internal to each group; that only a class orientation can unify an otherwise fragmented working class</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">; and insis</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Emphasis">ting on class unity implies the committed, active support for full equality within the class. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">Fighting racism inside the class and in society as a whole is fundamental to building class power. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">A third controversy relates to immigration and solidarity. To simply assert the righteousness of fully open borders in the present context of economic insecurity cannot help but elicit a backlash and will ultimately do little for refugees and future immigrants. Workers who have seen their own standards undermined over time without their unions or the government responding to this may have charitable sentiments but they are not going to prioritize open borders. </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">More can be achieved by trying to win people to a more liberal</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> but regulated </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Emphasis">border policy, by fighting for full equality of workers once they are here, and by insisting that refugees and new immigrants get the social supports they need to concretize that equality — all of which bring us into solidaristic struggles over union rights and the restoration and expansion of the welfare state. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">A fourth tension is that between the urgency of ecological time and the inherently extended epoch of revolutionary time. The environmental crisis demands change now but building the social force capable of bringing about that change — especially as it must mean a degree of democratized economic and social planning that inherently and fundamentally challenges corporate power — can’t help but take time even if should obviously be started now. A related friction is how to prioritize the environment since planetary survival is at stake without setting aside struggles for social justice. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">As the environmental crisis worsens, the greatest inequalities will revolve around access to the basics of food, water, and air so the crisis cannot be separated from its impact on inequality and justice. At the same time, unless one thinks that addressing the elite will solve the environmental crisis, the only path to building the social power necessary to transform society and deal with the environment is by way of incorporating issues of inequality and social justice.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> Finally, as we turn to the programmatic content of a socialist current we must confront a set of thornier issues lying behind any focus on jobs and public goods and services. Progressive policies on health care, education, housing, public transportation, minimum wages, labor rights, jobs, just environmental transitions, etc. are of course central to building a broad base. But </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Emphasis">without a further and more radical set of policies that involve fundamental economic interventions such as challenging free trade, private control over investment, and the financial power of banks and investment houses, the social policies simply cannot be sustained. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">In fact, in today’s context </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">more radical policies are essential for even achieving moderate reforms</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. This consideration shifts the emphasis from the terrain of policies to the terrain of power — to an alternative politics rooted in developing the deepest political capacities.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000001"> </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000001"> </span></p><h3 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading3"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000003">1 --- Revolutionary Citizenship</span></h3><h4 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading4"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">The alternative is revolutionary citizenship – a redefinition of democratic social life that centers a de-valorization of capital itself.

This is a general principle</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> of the thing. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">There’s only one problem: It’s “dead wrong,”</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> Hanauer said flatly. And it’s based on the wrong sort of mathematics—like using addition to try to multiply and divide. “</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">The economy isn’t this linear equilibrium system, it’s a complex, nonlinear, nonequilibrium systems, and is best understood not mechanistic terms, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">but eco-systemically.” Nonlinear</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">, nonequilibrium mathematics is a good deal more difficult</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> and complex than the math used by neoclassical economists. But the qualitative picture it paints is not that hard to grasp, as Hanauer explained it: </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Once you see it eco-systemically</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">, what you can see</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> quite clearly </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">is</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> that arguing, for instance, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">that if wages go up employment will go down would be like arguing that if plants grow animals will shrink</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">, right? Literally, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">that’s silly</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> On the contrary, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">businesses essentially eat the wages of workers</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">right? They subsist on the wages of workers</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, and so obviously, to a reasonable degree, the more wages rise, the more businesses—again, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">pressing the metaphor—have to eat</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">And that’s why the fundamental law of capitalism is that if workers have more money businesses have more customers</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">and need more workers</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. With that in mind, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">the folly of trickle-down economics comes sharply into focus</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, as Hanauer highlighted next: What’s very clear, is that when you concentrate income in fewer and fewer hands, you’re essentially killing that feedback loop. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">You create a vicious cycle. The typical worker to maintain their share of income over the last 30 years, as you well know, the median wage wouldn’t be $50,</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">000 it would be something like $75</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">,000.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> If that was true,, think about how many more cars who be purchased every year in this country. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065">There are 3 percent of Americans who own exactly the car that they want</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, but the other 97 percent would like a new one! In short, Hanauer summed up, in a technological capitalist economy, growth “isn’t a consequence of concentrating capital in the hands of a few people, and hoping it will trickle down,” rather it’s “a consequence of the feedback loop between increasing amounts of innovation and entrepreneurship and demand.” And that, in turn made Hanauer’s criticism of Obama’s missed opportunity crystal clear: When you see it that way, when you explain where growth comes from, in a realistic way, then you can see that inequality isn’t just unfair, it’s actually terrible for the economy and for business. And </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">that’s the opportunity that Pres. Obama missed. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Because he is surrounded by trickle-down thinkers who still sort of secretly believe that if we just made rich people richer</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">, that would be fine. And this explains for instance, why it took the Obama administration six years to even notice that they had the ability, for instance, to increase the overtime threshold</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. Inquiring minds want to know, why it took them six years. And, by the way, that somebody else had to point it out.</span></p><h4 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading4"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">Neoliberal economics are flawed and foster rampant inequality</span></h4><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000005"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Style13ptBold">Byline, interviewing Ha-Joon Chang, ’15 </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">(Byline; 4/14/15; Byline, Manchester journalism, interviewing noted heterodox economist Ha-Joon Chang, a South Korean institutional economist specialising in development economics.

They believe it is possible to work within the market to protect the environment while pursuing economic growth. In his continuation of the poker-chip model, Costanza (1987) suggest a a market-based approach of taxation, so that players like the Once-ler find it uneconomical to harvest more Truffula tufts than a prescribed optimum. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The Once-ler’s pollution could also be taxed if it exceed optimum levels</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, incentivizing him to invest in environmentally clean methods of production. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">This tax-based internalization would require the Lorax to assign private property rights over the Truffulla commons so the Once-ler would be liable for its environmental degradation</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. More importantly, however, it requires an accurate economic evaluation of the biophysical and ethical value of Truffula tree ecosystem to determine and appropriate optimum of Once-ler consumption. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">The inadequacy of such evaluations is greatly overlooked</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Ecological economics</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">a school of thought which rejects the notion that neoclassical market tools can be used to protect the environment</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">, would reject the proposition that the biophysical value of the Truffula ecosystem could be captured in a cost-benefit analysis</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. In his paper “Ecosystem services: From eye-opening metaphor to complexity blinder,” ecological economist Richard Norgaard (2010) </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">argues that the burden cannot be placed on ecologists to determine the economic value of nature</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, because, as scientists in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment charged with doing so discovered, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">ecological studies rarely evaluate nature in anthropocentric terms</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. He surmises that to advocate for such evaluations would be unscientific because they would inevitably mask ecosystem complexity providing the market with false signals. Consider again Constanza’s poker-chip model, modified with the assumption that science cannot be relied upon to determine whether the Once-ler should taxed 1 ‘chip’ or 2 for taking 3. Is it not reasonable to assume that the model would succumb to pro-market pressures and bias policy to choose 1 chip? Unless the biophysical integrity of the system could be maintained by a 1 chip tax through sheer luck, continual application of this ‘solution’ would enable the Once-ler to destroy the Truffula ecosystem. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">The only solution to preserve the commons would therefore be to understand the fallaciousness of ‘wise-use’ and change the game as ecological economists such as Herman Daly </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">(1991) suggest: de-incetivize growth by taxing the Once-ler’s capital and pass legislation invoking the precautionary principle, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">requiring resource taxes to be based on the worst-case-scenario</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. The inability of neoclassical economics to evaluate the moral value of the Truffula commons also renders its solutions insufficient to avoid the disaster in The Lorax. If the Once-ler decided that, despite de-inciventization of growth and heavy resource taxation, it made economic sense to destroy all the Truffula trees to collect the interest, as mathematician Colin Clark (1973) </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">determined could be the case with natural capital under a private property rights regime</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">he would be within his rights as a private property owner to do so</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. The re-allocation of the Truffula commons from private property to state property and legislation based on the moral rights of future generations and animals would therefore be the only way to avoid disaster. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">Ecological economist Kostas Bithas </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">(2011) </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">argues that because markets can only make evaluations based on present-day consumers a neoclassical regime cannot protect the rights of future consumers to have access to natural capital</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. As neoclassical solutions to this injustice would invoke Harwick’s rule they would simply require the Once-ler to make investments in human capital to compensate for the natural capital he destroyed. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">An example of this rule is provided by Mark Sagoff </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">(1997), </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">who uses the Green Revolution</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">, which doubled food production from 1961-1964 as a result of artificial selection for high yield crop variates</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, as evidence that human capital can replace natural organisms. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">If this substitution approach were to be applied in the The Lorax</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, the Once-ler could simply invest in artificial breeding or genetic modification of new Truffula tree varieties and continue his growth. Ecological economists criticize this substitution as “weak sustainability” and argue on moral grounds that natural capital is irreplaceable by human design (van den Bergh, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">2010). Taking the moral stance that humans cannot create better resources than Nature has provided</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, only a fiduciary trust which preserves the moral right of future generations to natural property as described by Emollin Pallida (2002) </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">would be sufficient to save the Truffula trees</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. The Bar-ba-loots, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Humming fish and Swamee-Swans also have no rights under the economic model as they are not economic actors</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">.

One of the central pillars in ecological economics is the notion that these forms of capital are complimentary factors of production. Manufactured capital is created by natural resources therefore to produce more manufactured capital more natural capital is required. This is the definition of complimentary factors. (Daly, 1999) Ecological economists do not believe that the market is self regulating and prices fully reflect the scarcity of resources. Daly argues that as growth exceeds he environments ability to sustain that growth, an increasing number of negative externalities develop. He therefore advocates adjusting the price level of resource to adequately reflect these negative externalities. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Unlike the neoclassical view that there are no upper limits on economic growth</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">and a high growth strategy should be promoted</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, Ecological economists believe that high growth will exacerbate the damage to nature and environment. This growth is most likely to lead to ecological disasters. They also argue that the notion that economic growth leads to an increase in social welfare is a weak assumption.

This implies that specific measures other than those in the normal market need to be developed in order to conserve natural capital</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. This may include limits on a macroeconomic level; it is not possible for the economic system to grow beyond the boundaries of the regeneration process as well as the waste-absorption capacities of the environment (Harris, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">2003). Increasing numbers of economists are realising that if the environmental resources are not included in calculations</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">a holistic view of the factors of production cannot be obtained</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Daly has proposed an alternative to neoclassic growth theory</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, namely stead state economy (SSE), this model differs to that of growth theory in that it endeavours to incorporate the biophysical limits and ethical considerations highlighted by various ecological economists. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">It is his view that the concept of unlimited growth as adopted by neoclassic economists does not incorporate the biophysical limits that exist</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">.

Pointing this out usually leads to the eternal (and eternally fun) debate over whether economics is a real science. The profession's detractors say that if you don’t make successful predictions, you aren’t a science. Economists will respond that seismologists can’t forecast earthquakes, and meteorologists can’t forecast hurricanes, and who cares what’s really a “science” anyway. The debate, however, misses the point. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Forecasts aren’t the only kind of predictions a science can make</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Style13ptBold-000069">.

Usually, when you make a new physics theory, you use it to predict some new phenomenon -- some kind of thing that no one has seen before, because they haven’t bothered to look. For example, quantum mechanics has gained a lot of support from predicting the strange new things like quantum tunneling or quantum teleportation. </span><span class="pt-Style13ptBold-000034">Other times, a theory will predict things we have seen before, but will describe them in terms of other things that we thought were totally separate, unrelated phenomena. This is called unification</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Style13ptBold-000069">, and it’s a key part of what philosophers think science does.

As Richard Feynman, the great physicist and amateur philosopher of science, put it: When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000001"> </span></p><h2 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading2"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000002">Framework</span></h2><h3 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading3"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000003">Bottom-up analysis/advocacy</span></h3><h4 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading4"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">Top-down analysis and focus on the agent and technologies of neoliberalism fail and cement the status quo</span></h4><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000005"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-Style13ptBold">Bishop 14 </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">Erin Bishop Master of Interdisciplinary Studies program Indiana University “Neglected resistance: Counter-conducts and neoliberal governmentality through risk in International Relations” CISD Yearbook of Global Studies, Vol 1, No 1, June 2014, pp. 229-247 </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029">Implications for the Scholarship and Resistance I have argued that </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">in the existing IR literature</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> on the risk of terrorism, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">resistance to neoliberal governmentality only features as an after-thought, if at all.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> This </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">neglect of resistance limits analysis of governance through risk</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000029"> </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">both in terms of the specialist literature, and more generally for a number of reasons.

As Joseph explains, this serves to reinforce the school of thought endorsing, “the unstoppable nature of [neoliberal] globalisation and the view that we have lost control of macro forces.” (2012: 172).

Foucault does not explicitly tackle the role of civil society in current or recent governmentalities in his studies; rather, to draw on his work to approach civil society, one has to interpret his other analyses, for instance those concerning a subject’s possibilities to challenge the forms of subjection and subjective emancipation. Here I content myself with opening up ways through which, following Foucault’s thought, one can practice counter-conducts or find means for it, and sketching out how civil society could be understood as ‘heterotopia,’ so that it would serve the emergence of these kinds of new subjectivations.

The expected outcome of criticism is that they would no longer be taken for granted. 89 One influential way in which the intellectual can practice criticism is to make resistance against different forms of power the starting point of her/his analysis, because resistance brings to light the power relations and more or less teleological thoughts of conduct, domination and control hidden in societal practices.90 As Foucault is interested in the ‘aesthetics of existence’—in particular in his later works—he mainly pays attention to forms of resistance that touch upon the subjectivation of an individual. 91 He finds many examples of ‘immediate resistance’ against the effects of power in modern societies: opposition to gender domination, domination of psy-experts, and administrative subjections of citizens into different categories and classes. According to Foucault, struggles against subjection and related domination increased significantly in the latter part of the 20th century.92 These struggles and forms of collective organization seem to be the ones that Foucault appreciates the most in our current world. He claims that people resist—and they have to do that—especially those forms of power, and ways of using it, that take away their control and power over themselves and violate the principles of this self-governance, even when the use of power ostensibly strives for strengthening individual liberties, capacities, or security, like in the case of surveillance, for instance. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">Liberal governmentality leans greatly on the voluntariness and consent of people (citizens) </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">to obey particular modes of governance</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, and their freedom and activeness to engage and innovate in society. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">The capability of governance to reach its goals in such conduct of human subjects is a question of the ‘art of government.’ </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">93 </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">The capability of human subjects to submit to those external subjections Foucault calls the ‘art of living.’ </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">94 Because subjectivity is formed and transformed in the interplay of subjection and subjectivation, the art of living also includes another side. That is to say, people constantly swerve the subjections—the manuscripts of subjectivation—assigned to them, whether by acknowledging it or not. This is named the “art of not being governed too much” or the “art of being governed only to a certain extent” in Foucauldian studies. 95 </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">It is possible to find</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> three more or less explicit </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">examples of</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> the above-mentioned </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">counter conduct of the modern self, searching for as an autonomous aesthetics of existence</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> as possible in Foucault’s works. First of all, when speaking about modern forms of aesthetics of life, Foucault refers to the Baudelairean and Flaubertian understanding of the individual. Through criticism, Foucault wants to make way for Dandyism; a flâneur-like subject, who makes her/himself the target of search and transformation without committing to fixed forms of subjectivity. Instead, subjectivity has to emerge again and again and differently on different occasions.96 Baudelaire’s modernity does not liberate man in his own being, but rather compels him to face the task of producing himself. In other words, modern man is not going off to discover himself, his truth, and his hidden inner secrets, but he rather tries to invent himself through creating his personal aesthetics of the self.97 This requires the social condition of creative action (i.e. civil society), which makes room for such an understanding of the self and which, at least in principle, is most possible in the context of liberal practices of government and their temporal infinity. In the preface to the French edition of Madness and Civilization, Foucault quotes surrealist René Chari as saying “cultivate your strangeness.” 98 By this he refers to those elements of subjectivity which have been limited outside the sphere of normality but which people would like to practice. Hence the second example of counter-conduct and “aesthetization” of life: transgression. Transgression is compulsory for revealing the invisible boundaries of normality and deviance. It can show the matters of course that regulate our existence and actions in particular contexts and moments.99 Foucault’s third example of counter-conduct can be called invisibility or withdrawal. It is a conscious or subconscious escape from identifications in situations where governance expects certain kind of self-identification from a person. Its target is the governmental expectation that the person has to make her/himself visible—and hence knowable—so that she/he can become the subject-object of particular technologies of governance. If a technological practice cannot identify a subject in accordance with its own codes, the process cannot function systematically and predeterminedly, and the subject becomes ‘dangerous’ to its functionality. 100 In addition to the different possibilities of aesthetics of existence, Foucault also observes a form of resistance called ‘tactical reversal’ in the first volume of The History of Sexuality. 101 The concept and embedded idea is close to Marxist approaches on the antagonistic and conflicted power relations of society: societal change, hence, requires that “a specific configuration of power and knowledge can be thwarted by reversing the mechanisms whereby this relation is sustained.” 102 Tactical reversal means resistance “in which it is the possibility of reversal within specific force relations, the contestation of specific objects and impositions of power on subjects.” 103 Hartmann and Thompson both take a critical stance towards this model of resistance, because resistance is approached as reactive action taking place within the boundaries of a certain dispositive, and not as a positive, productive force on its own terms. According to Foucault’s concentration on the aesthetics of existence in his late studies, essays, and interviews, 104 and his ideas on criticism as intellectual action that opens possibilities and means for resistance without definite ends, one can assume that he also endorses this critique, at least partially. However, if we look at the empirical or contemporary analytical examples in Foucault’s works that I described above, we can see that they often involve a mixture of tactical reversal and perhaps more proactive actions of an ‘aesthetics of existence’—or the art of not being governed too much.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000001"> </span></p><div class="pt-000000"><h1 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading1"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont">Aff Answers</span></h1></div><h2 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading2"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000002">Framework</span></h2><h3 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading3"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000003">2AC --- Framework</span></h3><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000008"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000009"> </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000070"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">Frame the alternative within consequentialism – neoliberalism is most ethical because all </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000071">practical</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010"> alternatives are worse and cause violence</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">-coming up with an alternative economic system </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000021">matters</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">-don’t take a leap of faith</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">-any alternative is utopian and unachievable</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">-capitalism can be reformed</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">Richards 9 – PhD in Philosophy @ Princeton</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">Jay Richards, PhD with honors in Philosophy and Theology from Princeton, “Money, Greed, and God: Why Capitalism Is the Solution and Not the Problem,” pg. 31-32</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">Myth</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> no. 1: </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">The Nirvana Myth (contrasting capitalism with an unrealizable ideal rather than with its live alternatives</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">) But the myth can have subtle effects even if we reject utopian schemes.

Ironically, as the basis for a politics, antiracism seems to reflect, several generations downstream, the victory of the postwar psychologists in depoliticizing the critique of racial injustice by shifting its focus from the social structures that generate and reproduce racial inequality to an ultimately individual, and ahistorical, domain of “prejudice” or “intolerance.” (No doubt this shift was partly aided by political imperatives associated with the Cold War and domestic anticommunism.) Beryl Satter’s recent book on the racialized political economy of “contract buying” in Chicago in the 1950s and 1960s, Family Properties: Race, Real Estate, and the Exploitation of Black Urban America, is a good illustration of how these processes worked; Robert Self’s book on Oakland since the 1930s, American Babylon, is another. Both make abundantly clear the role of the real estate industry in creating and recreating housing segregation and ghettoization. </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000018"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000057"> </span></p><h4 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading4"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">Neoliberal policies don’t prop up neoliberal systems </span></h4><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">Kirsten </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">Bell &amp;</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> Judith </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">Green 16</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">.

Broadly speaking, neoliberalism refers to the capitalist restructuring that has occurred around the globe since the 1970s in the name of a ‘post-Cold War, post-welfare state model of social order that celebrates unhindered markets as the most effective means of achieving economic growth and public welfare’ (Maskovsky &amp; Kingfisher, 2001, p. 105). Thatcherism in the UK and Reaganism in the USA are often highlighted as prototypical manifestations of neoliberalism; however, policies informed by a similar market-centric logic were introduced in a more moderate form in a variety of social democracies (e.g. Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden) (Brenner &amp; Theodore, 2002; Maskovsky &amp; Kingfisher, 2001; Ward &amp; England, 2007). They were also exported to the Global South through the structural adjustment and fiscal austerity pro- grammes enforced by institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (Brenner &amp; Theodore, 2002). </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">In its strictest sense, neoliberalism refers to a macro-economic doctrine</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, but there is huge variation in the ways the term is employed in contemporary scholarship (Ferguson, 2010). Although its conceptual intelligibility is often taken for granted (Garland &amp; Harper, 2012), neoliberalism is variously used as: a sloppy synonym for capitalism itself, or as a kind of shorthand for the world economy and its inequalities … a kind of abstract causal force that comes in from outside to decimate local livelihoods … [or] a broad, global cultural formation characteristic of a new era of ‘millennial capitalism’ – a kind of global meta-culture, characteristic of our newly deregulated, insecure, and speculative times. And finally, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">‘neoliberalism’ can be indexed to a sort of ‘</span><span class="pt-Emphasis">rationality’</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline"> in the Foucauldian sense, linked less to economic dogmas or class projects than to specific mechanisms of government, and </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">recognizable modes of creating subjects</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">.

Consider, for example, neoliberalism as governmentality – one of the more common ways the term is employed by CPH authors. As Kipnis (2008) observes, the key defining features of this variant of neoliberalism: governing from a distance; the emphasis on calculability; and the promotion of self-activating, disciplined, individuated subjects, can be found in a variety of contexts that are historically and culturally distant from Western neoliberal or liberal governing philosophies. In his words, ‘These three categories correspond to broad human potentialities that have been imagined in a wide variety of ways in a broad range of settings and that have become more prevalent in all state-governed and industrial societies’ (p. 284, 240 Editorial emphasis added). Thus, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">characterizing such features exclusively in terms of neoliberalism runs the risk of </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">exaggerating its scope</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">by</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">reifying it into a globally dominant force or stage of history</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Kipnis, 2008). </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">It also runs the risk of </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">eliding other processes</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">that deserve analytic attention in their own right.

Hervik and Thurston (2016), in their account of how Norwegian men discuss their responsibilities for health, note that the specificities of the welfare state in Norway configure assumptions embedded in talk about ‘responsibility’. Rather than simply reading off the espousal of ‘personal responsibility for health’ as another reflection of neoliberal hegemony, Hervik and Thurston note that in this context, responsibility for health is rooted in a participatory model of the welfare state, in which principles of egalitarianism and social democracy may have very different implications for public health than in welfare states where the focus is on individual choice and self-sufficiency. Similarly, Nourpanah Editorial 241 and Martin (2016) delineate both parallels and divergences between the discursive framings of health promotion described in Western states and those they document in Iran, where there is an absence of focus on consumption, despite similar orientations towards individual choice. In general, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">rather than </span><span class="pt-Emphasis">reifying neoliberalism as a monolithic entity,</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">it may be more productive to speak of ‘</span><span class="pt-Emphasis">neoliberalization’ as an always partial and incomplete process</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> (Ward &amp; England, 2007). </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">This raises potentially fruitful questions around when, where, and in what ways the economic, political and cultural intersect with health.

To be sure, part of what they said seemed to corroborate this, yet their words were empty. Their discourse was classical Orwellian doublespeak that says the opposite of what one actually means. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The fundamental role of the State is, indeed, that of regulator, defi ning and establishing itself as the constitutional-legal system. But the State can also be a protector, an inducer, an enabler and, in the initial stages of economic development, a producer. Neoliberalism not only rejected a State with these qualities – qualities that distinguished or were beginning to characterize the social and democratic State of capitalism’s “30 glorious years” (1945-1975) – but also did not want a regulatory State</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065">. The name “regulatory State” was vacuous. Its goal was to deregulate, not regulate. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">For Neoliberalism, the State should become “minimal”, and this meant at least four things: safety net, namely, the entire protective system through which modern societies seek to remedy the blindness of the market regarding social justice; third, it should stop inducing productive investment and technological &amp; scientifi c development,</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065"> ESTUDOS AVANÇADOS 23 (66), 2009 9 that is, it should relinquish leadership of a national development strategy; and, fourth, it should stop regulating the markets and, in particular, the fi nancial markets, deemed to be self-regulating. The most insistently repeated proposal of the Neoliberal creed has been the deregulation of the marketplace. How could it be possible, then, to speak of a regulatory State? Much better, and more forthright, would be to say “deregulatory State”. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">What neoliberals aspired to, both in rich countries where their ideology emerged and in the developing world, was a weak State that allowed national economies to become a playing fi eld for large corporations, their top executives and fi nancial agents to obtain all kinds of rents – in lieu of moderate interest rates, fair business profi ts and professional wages, the legitimate forms of reasonably the economic elites.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065"> Neoliberalism was the hegemonic ideology from the early 1980s to the early 2000s. It was the ideology adopted and promoted by American governments since Ronald Reagan. After the turn of the century, however, its intrinsic irrationality, its failure to encourage economic growth in developing countries, its effi cacy in concentrating income for the richest 2% of every rich or developing society that adopted its ideas, and the increased macroeconomic instability (as shown by the successive fi nancial crises of the 1990s) became clear indications of the exhaustion of Neoliberalism. Is it possible that, by forcing the State to intervene so forcibly to rescue indebted banks, companies and families, the crash of October 2008 and </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">the ongoing economic and fi nancial crisis might represent the collapse of this ideology – the end of its hegemony? The much-disparaged State was fi nally called upon to save the market…</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065"> Neoliberalism today is a dead ideology, an embarrassing remembrance that owes its spectral existence only to the nefarious consequences it had on the societies it victimized. Am I, perhaps, being unfair with Neoliberalism and with the neoliberals? Having myself been always critical of this ideology, I call upon the testimony of someone wholly unsuspected, Francis Fukuyama (2004), a conservative but not a neoliberal, who in his book, State-building: governance and world order in the 21st century, vigorously criticizes the neoliberal policies imposed by the United States on less developed countries, particularly in Africa. He showed how such policies failed states1 . I am aware that failed nation-States are a borderline case, but borderline cases can help us to clarify ambiguous situations that so often prevail in society. For a long time, I defi ned Neoliberalism as radical economic liberalism, as the ideology of minimal State and self-regulated markets. Although these defi nitions are correct, the fi rst poses a rather serious problem. After all, both political and economic liberalism were social conquests – and we’ve had many forms of radical liberalism that were not in the least neoliberal.2 It is better to defi ne Neoliberalism by making a historical comparison with Liberalism. Liberalism, in the 18th century, was the ideology of a bourgeois middle class struggling against an oligarchy of landowners and weapons masters supported by an autocratic State. Therefore, if we wish to characterize Neoliberalism, a 10 ESTUDOS AVANÇADOS 23 (66), 2009 reactionary ideology, it is not enough to say that it is a radical type of economic liberalism, because the liberal radicalism of the 18th and early 19th century was revolutionary. Let us, then, attempt to see what Neoliberalism is or was historically. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Neoliberalism</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065"> is the ideology that the wealthy used in the late 20th century against the poor, the workers and a social democratic State. It is, therefore, an eminently reactionary ideology. It is an ideology that, bolstered by the neoclassical economic theory of rational expectations, by the so-called new institutionalism, by the theory of public choice and by the more radical forms of the rational choice school, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">orchestrated a veritable political and theoretical assault against the State and against regulated markets over the last 30 years. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065">As a result, if we compare this period with the immediately preceding years, we will see that in the rich countries growth rates were reduced, fi nancial and economic instability was increased and income become concentrated among the wealthiest 2% of the population. As for the developing countries that accepted the ideology – the followers of the Washington consensus –, growth rates were insuffi cient for them to even hope catching up. State </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">The great institutional construction of modern societies is the State</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065">. Hegel was the fi rst to understand this fact, to see it as the ultimate crystallization of reason, as the loftiest endeavor of human rationality. For us, it diffi cult to understand the claims of the great philosopher’s, because </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">we see our own State as an imperfect normative institution, always needy of reforms (the constitutional-legal system), and as an organizational institution peopled by public servants and politicians replete with administrative and ethical problems (the apparatus of the State or public administration). These, however, are merely differences between design and reality that do not disavow the State as a construct of human will, as the ultimate pursuit of rationality.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065"> </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Whereas the economy and society conceived with no heed to the State remain in the realm of necessity, politics and the State are the realm of freedom and human will</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065">. In the economy and in society, everyone defends their own interests and only secondarily cooperates with others – and both actions are carried out in a rather disorderly manner. There are no common goals, no collective choices. In this scenario, individuals are guided solely by their reason to fulfi ll their own self-interests. Because of this, when economists who defi ne themselves as liberals [i.e., as conservatives in the American sense] seek to develop theories about society and the economy without considering politics and the State, they inevitably fall into the perversion of determinism. Determinism is a proper doctrine in the natural sciences, but it lures economists by making their science more “scientifi c”, apparently more precise or seemingly better equipped to provide explanations. In reality, however, economics and other social sciences can only be rendered deterministic through a radical simplifi cation of human behavior that is intrinsically misleading, because there is always an element of ESTUDOS AVANÇADOS 23 (66), 2009 11 freedom and unpredictability in each human being and because social behavior is never the mere sum of individual behaviors. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Brought together in society, individuals share values and beliefs and build institutions that themselves change the patterns of social behavior. It is by establishing a legitimate and effective constitutional-legal system – the State – and by means of other social institutions that citizens can transform their society and build their Republic in accordance with those values.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065"> When attempting to understand society and the economy, we must always consider the State as well, its government and other institutions. As Karl Polanyi (1944, p. 33) said: “Economic liberalism misread the history of the Industrial Revolution because it insisted on judging social events from the economic viewpoint”, because it believed in the “spontaneity” of social change and ignored the “elementary truths” of “political science and statecraft”. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Although concerned with their own interests, citizens can be called free when, in addition to this, they show themselves capable of regulating society and the economy, of organizing the common good, of building their nation and their State; in short, of changing their fate for the better. Success in this undertaking is always relative – but, if we believe in progress, we should reject pessimism and cynicism, and remember that the realm of freedom will slowly impose itself upon the realm of necessity, and that humankind, by constructing the State, will gradually give rise to national societies and a world society that are more prosperous, freer, fairer and environmentally-friendly. The social or welfare State and the social capitalism that European societies (particularly in Scandinavia) have built are far from paradisiacal, but they are a very signifi cant sign of progress.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline-000065"> This does not mean that citizens of those countries can afford to give themselves over to self-complacency. On the contrary, they remain engaged in an ongoing critique of their States’ practices and institutions, this being the only way to advance a perpetually evolving construction. Regarding this point, I always remember a German social scientist who, during a seminar in a developing country with much more serious social and economic problems than Germany’s, embarked on a ferocious critical analysis of his own native land. The other participants were taken aback, because they were used to criticizing their own society but saw the more advanced countries as something to emulate. In truth, however, a country and its society can only be deemed more advanced if its citizens have not lost their critical sense. Because they know that building a good society depends on the ability of each one to cooperate and commit to others; in particular, it depends on their ability to establish a good State in which social objectives and commitments have been embedded.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000035"> </span></p><h2 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading2"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000002">Alt</span></h2><h3 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading3"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000003">2AC --- Alt Fails</span></h3><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000001"> </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000070"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">Alternatives to capitalism fail – lack of individual choice results in tyranny and failure</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">Meltzer</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">, Professor of Political Economy at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Business, Visiting Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, First Recipient of the AEI Irving Kristol Award, and Chairman of the International Financial Institution Advisory Commission, ‘</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">9</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> (Allan, March 12, “Why Capitalism?” 2008-2009 Bradley Lecture Series, http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.29525,filter.all/pub_detail.asp)</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">Alternatives to Capitalism  </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">Critics of capitalism </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">emphasize their dislike of greed and self-interest.

Second, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">they ignore individual differences. In place of individual choice under capitalism, they substitute rigid direction done to achieve some proclaimed end such as equality, fairness, or justice. These ends are not precise and, most important, individuals differ about what is fair and just. In practice, the </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000072">rulers' choices are enforced, often using fear, terror, prison</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">, or other punishment. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">The </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">history </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">of the twentieth century </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">illustrates how enforcement of promised ends became the </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000072">justification for deplorable means</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">.

Ludwig von Mises recognized in the 1920s that fixing prices and planning resource use omitted an essential part of the allocation problem. Capitalism allocates by letting relative prices adjust to equal the tradeoffs expressed by buyers' demands. Fixing prices eliminates the possibility of efficient allocation and replaces consumer choice with official decisions. Some gain, but others lose; the losers want to make choices other than those that are dictated to them.  </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">Not all Socialist societies have been brutal</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. In the nineteenth century, followers of Robert Owen, the Amana people, and many others chose a Socialist system. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">Israeli pioneers chose a collectivist system</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, the kibbutz. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">None of these arrangements produced sustainable growth. None survived. All faced the problem of imposing allocative decisions that satisfied the decision-making group, sometimes a majority, often not.

There are products that satisfy many different tastes or beliefs.  Theodor </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">Adorno was a leading critic of postwar capitalism </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">as it developed in his native Germany, in Europe, and in the United States. He found the popular culture vulgar, and he distrusted the workers' choices. He wanted a Socialism that he hoped would uphold the values he shared with other intellectuals.

He disliked jazz, so he was not opposed to Hitler's ban in the 1930s. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">But Adorno offered no way of achieving the culture he desired other than to impose his tastes on others and ban all choices he disliked</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">.

The Templeton Foundation recently ran an advertisement reporting the answers several prominent intellectuals gave to the question: "Does the free market corrode moral character?" Several respondents recognized that free markets operate within a political system, a legal framework, and the rule of law. The slave trade and slavery became illegal in the nineteenth century. Before this a majority enslaved a minority. This is a major blot on the morality of democratic choice that public opinion and the law eventually removed. In the United States those who benefitted did not abandon slave owning until forced by a war.  Most respondents to the Templeton question took a mixed stand. The philosopher John Gray recognized that greed and envy are driving forces under capitalism, but they often produce growth and raise living standards so that many benefit. But greed leads to outcomes like Enron and WorldCom that critics take as a characteristic of the system rather than as a characteristic of some individuals that remains under Socialism. Michael Walzer recognized that political activity also corrodes moral character, but he claimed it was regulated more effectively. One of the respondents discussed whether capitalism was more or less likely to foster or sustain moral abuses than other social arrangements. Bernard-Henri Levy maintained that alternatives to the market such as fascism and Communism were far worse.  None of the respondents mentioned Kant's view that mankind includes a range of individuals who differ in their moral character. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">Institutional and social arrangements like democracy and capitalism influence the moral choices individuals make or reject. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000072">No democratic capitalist country produced any crimes comparable to the murders committed by Hitler's Germany, Mao's China, or Lenin and Stalin's Soviet Union</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">.

Indeed, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">the “meltdown</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">” and its aftermath </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">may see the planet less</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, not more, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">open to alternatives to the neoliberal tendency</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, albeit with significant “corrections” as some economists were already calling them more than a year back. I am reminded here, simultaneously, of Reinhart Koselleck and the Manchester School of Anthropology in Central Africa. Koselleck, in his study of the Enlightenment and the pathogenesis of modern society, drew attention to the dialectics of crisis, critique, and correction; for its part, the Manchester School demonstrated the capacity of cycles of rupture and their repair to reproduce social systems and the order of values on which they are predicated (see, for example, Gluckman 2004; Turner 1996). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">Crisis</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, self-evidently, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">is always reproductive</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. But it frequently is. As Mike Davis (1995) once noted, “apocalypse” is often absorbed quickly into the history of the everyday, a process he describes as the “dialectic of ordinary disaster.” As talk has grown of “green shoots” sprouting in the wake of the economic devastation of the past two years or so, there have been signs of both crisis-driven critique in pursuit of “correction” and a return to the “ordinary.” Discourses of correction have come from both liberal and conservative sources. In a special edition of Harper’s in 2008, James Galbraith, Joseph Stiglitz, and others—most of them with impeccable liberal credentials—suggested a range of strategies to ensure that capitalism might reemerge relatively unscathed. They prescribed cures such as reforming the tax system, banning stock options as incentives, bringing into line the self-interest of the banking sector with those of the economy and society at large, and finding regulatory means to harness both the risk-laden excesses of the finance industry and the tendency to favor short-run profiteering over longer- term wealth production. Only one contributor to the debate, Eric Janszen— ironically, a venture capitalist—took a more radical line. He argued for a return to industrial capitalism, pointing out that all recent bubbles and busts are owed to government creating conditions for mammoth, “metastasiz[ing]” markets in financial speculation. Janszen apart, these efforts to “save capitalism” were symptomatic of a rush of similar liberal writings on the topic. Few of them—the notable exception being Gillian Tett’s extraordinary Fool’s Gold (2009)—delved deeply into the archaeol- ogy of the crisis itself or, more generally, into the inner workings of a global political economy whose complexity has increased exponentially over the past couple of decades. As a result, most have sought solutions along its outer surfaces. They have posited adjustments that might limit the material excesses of the neo- liberal tendency and, in particular, the market instabilities and conflicts of interest to which those excesses give rise. This, itself, is a function of the pervasive prac- tice of explaining all economic processes these days by recourse to one or another kind of utilitarian theory, which is why the four causes of the apocalypse, as John Lanchester (2009) has pointed out, are almost invariably taken to be “greed, stu- pidity, government, and the banks,” not anything in the structure of contemporary capitalism itself. The pursuit of explanations and panaceas in such terms, as we might expect, has its parallel on the Right, most notably perhaps in Richard Posner’s A Failure of Capitalism (2009), a salvo from the H alls of Friedmania. Note that Posner did not title the book “the failure”—using a definite article—but merely “a failure.” Posner, predictably and—in light of Tett’s account—spuriously, argues that individuals in the finance industry acted rationally in the years before the crisis. That crisis, in his view a fully fledged “depression,” is blamed, again predictably, on bad government and ill-considered, perfectible forms of deregu- lation. His “corrections,” though, belong to the same genus as those proffered by liberal economists: establish new forms of regulation that reduce the conflict between the rational self-interest of economic actors and the commonweal—the invisible old hand here, of course, being the economist of invisible hands, Adam Smith. In the final analysis, from this vantage, the point is to perfect free market economies by establishing the regulatory environment most conducive to a suc- cessfully deregulated world. In the meantime—and this is where the “dialectic of the ordinary” becomes salient—for all the talk of the urgent need for “correction,” we have seen a tangible return to business as usual, even bad-faith business. This is in spite of the fact that deeper crises appear inevitable, that employment statistics are worsening, that rates of poverty and inequality are rapidly rising, and so on. The buzzword in the City of London, in late June 2009, was “BAB”: “bonuses are back.” And, with them, the forms of finance capital from which they emanate. As Jonathan Freedland (2009), also commenting on Britain, wrote, “Nine months ago”—in 2008—“the financial crisis seemed certain to bring a revolution in our economy. . . . Change had to be on the way.” But now “look what has happened. . . . [Just] when the world seemed ready to bury the neoliberal regime . . . we have returned to [its ways and means].” In sum, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">despite the</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> stream of </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">assertions</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> during 2010 </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">that the crisis would have deep transformative effects, putting an end to the “neoliberal regime,” </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000072">most indi- cators suggest otherwise</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">For one thing, the </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000072">massive infusions of money into the banking industry and mega-business</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> on the part of national governments have </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">occurred without the regulatory initiatives </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">that were </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">promised to follow</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">.

Which may be why there have been so few legislative enactments anywhere promulgated to curb the practices that sparked the meltdown in the first place: per contra, while market forces have made it harder to negotiate toxic assets and to take some of the more extravagant gambles in the business of finance, the investment industry is widely reported not merely to have returned to its old ways, but to be inventing new “products” without palpable constraint. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">The </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000072">derivatives trade</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, it seems, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">is </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000072">rising</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013"> again</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. So, too, are the ramparts around “economic liberalism.” A recent article in The Economist (2009) argues that, notwithstanding “the biggest economic calamity in 80 years . . . the free-market paradigm . . . deserves a robust defence.” </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">These are not the only signs</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> that the capillaries of the neoliberal tendency and the “free-market paradigm” continue to embrace us. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">There are many others.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> Some are obvious, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">like the continuing </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000072">dominance of the corporate sector</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">: its relative immunity from most legal challenge</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, even when its enterprises violate the being, bodies, belongings, or bioenvironment of ordinary citizens; its </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">enjoyment of favor- able taxation regimes</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> and, increasingly, the </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">use of laws of eminent domain to expand its horizons; the protection of its</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> physical, financial, and intellectual </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000072">prop- erty</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, sometimes by recourse to police violence, as an ostensible function of the collective good; its </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">capacity to influence</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> the disposition of the public treasury and </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">public policy</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> and, reciprocally, to have insurgent action directed against it pros- ecuted as common crime—for example, in mass protests against the privatization of such “natural” assets as water and land. Other signs are less obvious, like </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">the growing hegemony of legal orders</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, founded on constitutions of distinctly neolib- eral design, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">that favor individual rights over collective well-being; that limit the responsibility of government to protect</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> or provision </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">its citizens; that tend to criminalize</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> race, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">poverty, and counterpolitic</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">s, in part by outlawing the salience of social cause or consequence; that subject what were once everyday democratic processes to the finality of judicial action, thereby juridifying politics to the exclu- sion of other forms of social action; that displace the “hot” sovereignty of the people into the “cold” sovereignty of the law; and </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">that treat all citizens as rational, self-interested, rights-bearing actors</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> and the world as a community of contract. (For more on neoliberal constitutionalism, see, for example, Schneiderman [2000] and Comaroff and Comaroff [2006].) I could go on in this vein. To do so, however, would be to risk stating the obvi- ous. But allow me one observation. Perhaps the most significant capillaries of the neoliberal that remain with us have to do with the state and governance. Foucauldians would prefer “governmentality” here; they have a point. Broadly speaking, neoliberal etatism seems to be surviving well, even strengthening, in most places. As Foucault explained in The Birth of Biopolitics (2008), the rise of neoliberalism—his use of the noun—marked a radical transformation: whereas before, the state, among its various bureaucratic operations, “monitored” the work- ings of the economy, its “organizing principle” is now the market. Government actually has become business. And </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">nation-states have become</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> holding </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">companies</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> in and for themselves. In the upshot, the categorical distinction between politics and economics, that classical liberal fiction, is largely erased. Effective gover- nance, in turn, is measured with reference to asset management, to the attraction of enterprise, to the facilitation of the entrepreneurial activities of the citizen as homo economicus, and to the capacity to foster the accumulation—but not the redistribution—of wealth. Under these conditions, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">heads of state</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> begin to </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">resemble</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, and often actually are, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">CEOs who treat the population as</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> a body of </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">shareholders</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">; vide the likes of Silvio Berlusconi, who explicitly speaks of Italy as a company, or Dmitri Medvedev, head of Gazprom, Russia’s mightiest business and a major instrument of the country’s foreign policy. There is a more profound point here. Once upon a time, antineoliberal theory posited an opposition between the state and the free market, arguing that the antidote to the latter lay in the active inter- vention of the former. But the opposition is false, just another piece of the detri- tus of the modern history of capital. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">As states become mega-corporations</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> (Kremlin, Inc.; Britain, PLC; South Africa, Pty Ltd.; Dubai, Inc.)—</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">all of them</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, incidentally, branded and legally incorporated—they </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">become inextricably part of</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> the workings of </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">the market and</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, hence, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">no longer an “outside</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">,” an antidote, or an antithesis </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">from which to rethink</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> or reconstruct “</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">the neoliberal paradigm.” This</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, in part, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">is why government is increasingly reduced to</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> an exercise in the </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">technical management of capital, why ideologically founded politics appear dead</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, replaced by the politics of interest and entitlement and identity—three counterpoints of a single triangle.

The prime purpose of any democratic government is to ensure its own re-election, a goal which introduces significant temporal and spatial constraints to many of its political actions. Policies that might have short-term deleterious impacts on the well-being of substantial groups of voters may be avoided, especially if those impacts could be felt in the period preceding an election, and particularly so if they will affect people concentrated in key spatially defined constituencies.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> Such failures, according to Moore have been caused by bad governance, lack of transparency and the shortsightedness and greed of business and political leaders. Progress can be stalled, we will experience new shocks in old clothing, but the historical trend line must make us optimistic (Moore, 2003, p. 41).</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">For Moore, these aberrations will fall to “the self-correcting advantages of democracy”. However, many government actions are taken to promote re-election chances, which are geographically structured within their national territories and are not globally ‘self-correcting’. Furthermore, that geographical structuring of their internal representative democracy is linked to many of their international actions: protecting their electoral heartlands at home strongly influences how they play away.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">As Massey (2005) has argued, illustrated in the quotation at the start of this essay, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">the concept of globalisation is associated with calls for freedom which imply that space should be unbounded.

If you think there are only 280 million tons of copper in the ground, you'll think you'll be out of luck once you have dug it out. But talking about "known reserves" ignores the many ways available resources can be increased. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Prospecting has improved, for example. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">As recently as 2007, Brazil found the Sugar Loaf oil field off the coast of São Paulo, which could hold 40 billion barrels of oil.

The</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> oil </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">industry now drills deeper into the ground, farther out into the oceans, and higher up in the Arctic.

This is similar to the technological breakthrough of chemical flotation for copper, which made it possible to mine ores that had previously been thought worthless, and similar to the Haber-Bosch process, which made nitrogen fixation possible, yielding fertilizers that now help feed a third of humanity. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Aluminum is one of the most common metallic elements on earth. But extracting it was so difficult and expensive that not so long ago, it was more costly than gold or platinum. Napoleon III had bars of aluminum exhibited alongside the French crown jewels, and he gave his honored guests aluminum forks and spoons while lesser visitors had to make do with gold utensils. Only with the invention of the Hall-Héroult process in 1886 did aluminum suddenly drop in price and massively increase in availability. Most often, however, ingenuity manifests itself in much less spectacular ways, generating incremental improvements in existing methods that cut costs and increase productivity. None of this means that the earth and its resources are not finite.

So what’s behind the downtrend? There are a few explanations economists point to. First, the </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">income elasticity of demand for most commodities is typically lower than for manufactured goods</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. As a result, </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">increases in income tend to translate into greater demand growth for processed goods than for commodities, and hence price gains for finished goods outpace those for raw materials. Second, a long-term decline in transportation costs has had a more deflationary impact on commodities than on other goods</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. These costs ordinarily comprise a higher proportion of the delivered price of commodities than of manufactured goods. </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">Third, manufacturing has become less input-intensive over time, thanks to technological innovation, meaning relatively less demand for raw materials compared to finished goods. Fourth, productivity growth in the agricultural and mining sectors, which has been better overall than for manufactured goods, has tended to lower prices for processed goods in relative terms</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. For agricultural goods, productivity gains have allowed for rising global supply without the need to resort to less fertile land, while in the case of mineral goods, better ways of detecting and producing them have deepened the global reserve base and in some cases reduced production costs despite the accelerating rate at which these goods are pulled from the ground. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-StyleUnderline">Finally, the quality of manufactured products has improved over time. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">This relative shift in quality (as well as the difficulty of quantifying it, which prevents economists from isolating this variable) may contribute to the relative price decline of commodities in real terms. The </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">graphs</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> below showing the production and prices </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">of</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012"> a sample of three non-renewable resources—</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">copper, zinc, and aluminum ore</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">—</span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">reinforce the fact that growing production of finite goods simply does not mean that their real prices are doomed to rise as they become more scarce</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. The positive correlation between production and prices that you might expect just doesn’t exist over long stretches of time. Annual Real Prices and Global Production of Three Industrial Metals (1900-2011) Copper Zinc Aluminum Ore Though copper production has grown tenfold over the last century, inflation-adjusted prices are still lower than what they averaged between 1900 and 1920. Of course, there have been periods where real copper prices have trended upward, such as between 1930 and the mid-1970s. Occasionally prices have jumped sharply, as they did during World War I and then again by Asian industrialization in the mid-2000s. Still, the net effect of a hundred years of mining has been for inflation-adjusted prices to slope downwards. Zinc shows a similar trajectory. Production of the metal has climbed relentlessly since 1900; prices have jumped now and again, but over the long term, prices have stagnated at best or even declined. Aluminum ore, barely mined at all until the 1950s, is now extracted at a rate of more than 200 million metric tons per year. Yet prices haven’t followed suit. They have seen periods of massive price rises, only to come crashing down. Their unrelenting slide since 1974 has resulted in a downward net trend over the last 112 years.

Indeed, </span><span class="pt-TitleChar">the more a country's economy depends on foreign trade or investment, the more self-damaging it is to engage in aggression</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. n147 This idea is certainly not new. As Montesquieu penned in 1752: "Peace is the natural effect of trade. Two nations who traffic with each other become reciprocally dependent . . . and thus their union is founded on their mutual necessities." n148 The wisdom of Montesquieu's statement has become even more apparent in recent years. As the now-famous "Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention" by Thomas Friedman makes clear, </span><span class="pt-TitleChar">there is a point at which the desire of a country for trade and investment restricts the capacity for war-making by its leadership</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. n149 Economic integration places strong constraints on countries "plugged into the system": investors may withdraw billions of dollars, not merely retarding economic growth, but in some cases dispatching it altogether. </span><span class="pt-TitleChar">Any chance of a conflict is inhibited by the direct investments that natives have in foreign countries, and the investments that foreigners have in the home country</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. n150 Perhaps the simplicity of this argument makes it easy to dismiss.

Smith's great revelation was that political freedom would most likely emerge and persist under conditions of economic freedom, what we now call capitalism</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000091">. Our democratic system as defined in our Constitution incorporated respect for this economic system. Like Smith's invisible hand in the market, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">the Framers saw an invisible hand in our politics</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000091">.

In the two centuries since then, Smith's proposition has served to advance all of civilization. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">America has become the hope of the oppressed, the "mother of exiles" and the cradle of modern commerce. Twice, America considered turning away from economic freedom. In the Depression, nationalization was seriously considered</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000091">, and Presidents Roosevelt and Truman did attempt to take over several industries. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">In the late 1970s</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000091">, in the face of low growth and high inflation, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">the nation nearly</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000061"> </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000091">followed the advice of such economists as Harvard's Wassily Leontief and John Kenneth Galbraith to </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">establish government central planning.

The result has been today's extraordinary economic engine — Smith's entrepreneurial capitalism at work.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000091"> Indeed, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">research from the University of Maryland and Census Bureau shows that net jobs created by businesses less than five years old exceeded 20% per year during the '80s and '90s (equating to millions of jobs), while jobs created by more mature businesses remained essentially flat.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000061"> </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000091">Even so, what do we do now in the face of a new enemy to freedom, driven by a notion that our democratic way should be eliminated? </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">More than the export of democracy, it is the export of</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000092"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000072">entrepreneurial capitalism that can produce a new birth of peace and freedom around our globe</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">.

Four researchers who studied these connections found “a very strong, positive association between our [environmental] indicators and the level of economic development</span><span xml:space="preserve">.” A country that is very poor is too preoccupied with lifting itself out of poverty to bother about the environment at all. Countries usually begin protecting their natural resources when they can afford to do so. </span><span>When they grow richer, they start to regulate effluent emissions,</span><span xml:space="preserve"> and when they have still more resources they also begin regulating air quality. 19 A number of factors cause environment protection to increase with wealth and development. Environmental quality is unlikely to be a top priority for people who barely know where their next meal is coming from. Abating misery and subduing the pangs of hunger takes precedence over conservation. </span><span>When our standard of living rises we start attaching importance to the environment and obtaining resources to improve it.

Global </span><span>envir</span><span>onmental development resembles not so much a race for the bottom as a race to the top</span><span xml:space="preserve">, what we might call a “California effect.” The state of </span><span>California's Clean Air Acts,</span><span xml:space="preserve"> first introduced in the 1970s and tightened since, </span><span>were stringent emissions regulations that made rigorous demands on car manufacturers. Many prophets of doom predicted that firms and factories would move to other states, and California would soon be obliged to repeal its regulations. But instead the opposite happened: other states gradually tightened up their environmental stipulations.</span><span xml:space="preserve"> Because car companies needed the wealthy California market, manufacturers all over the United States were forced to develop new techniques for reducing emissions. Having done so, they could more easily comply with the exacting requirements of other states, whereupon those states again ratcheted up their requirements. </span><span>Anti-globalists usually claim that the profit motive and free trade together cause businesses to entrap politicians in a race for the bottom. The California effect implies the opposite: free trade enables politicians to pull profit-hungry corporations along with them in a race to the top</span><span xml:space="preserve">. This phenomenon occurs because </span><span>compliance with environmental rules accounts for a very small proportion of most companies' expenditures</span><span xml:space="preserve">. What firms are primarily after is a good business environment—a liberal economy and a skilled workforce— not a bad natural environment. </span><span>A review of research in this field shows that there are no clear indications of national environmental rules leading to a diminution of exports or to fewer companies locating in the countries that pass the rules. 20 This finding undermines both the arguments put forward by companies against environmental regulations and those advanced by environmentalists maintaining that globalization has to be restrained for environmental reasons. Incipient signs of the California effect's race to the top are present all over the world, because globalization has caused different countries to absorb new techniques more rapidly,</span><span xml:space="preserve"> and the new techniques are generally far gentler on the environment</span><span xml:space="preserve">. </span><span>Researchers have investigated steel manufacturing in 50 different countries and concluded that countries with more open economies took the lead in introducing cleaner technology. Production in those countries generated almost 20 percent less emissions than the same production in closed countries</span><span xml:space="preserve">. </span><span xml:space="preserve">This process is being driven by multinational corporations because they have a lot to gain from uniform production with uniform technology. Because they are restructured more rapidly, they have more modern machinery. And they prefer assimilating the latest, most environmentally friendly technology immediately to retrofitting it, at great expense, when environmental regulations are tightened up. </span><span>Brazil, Mexico, and China—the three biggest recipients of foreign investment—have followed a very clear pattern: the more investments they get, the better control they gain over air pollution</span><span xml:space="preserve">. The worst forms of air pollution have diminished in their cities during the period of globalization. When Western companies start up in developing countries, their production is considerably more environment-friendly than the native production, and they are more willing to comply with environmental legislation, not least because they have brand images and reputations to protect. Only 30 percent of Indonesian companies comply with the country's environmental regulations, whereas no fewer than 80 percent of the multinationals do so. One out of every 10 foreign companies maintained a standard clearly superior to that of the regulations. This development would go faster if economies were more open and, in particular, if the governments of the world were to phase out the incomprehensible tariffs on environmentally friendly technology. 21 Sometimes one hears it said that, for environmental reasons, the poor countries of the South must not be allowed to grow as affluent as our countries in the North. For example, in a compilation of essays on Environmentally Significant Consumption published by the National Academy of Sciences, we </span><span>find anthropologist Richard Wilk fretting that:   If everyone develops a desire for the Western high-consumption lifestyle, the relentless growth in consumption, energy use, waste, and emissions may be disastrous. 22 But studies show this to be colossal misapprehension</span><span>. On the contrary, it is in the developing countries that we find the gravest, most harmful environmental problems. In our affluent part of the world, more and more people are mindful of environmental problems such as endangered green areas. Every day in the developing countries, more than 6,000 people die from air pollution when using wood, dung, and agricultural waste in their homes as heating and cooking fuel. UNDP estimates that no fewer than 2.2 million people die every year from polluted indoor air. This result is already “disastrous” and far more destructive than atmospheric pollution and industrial emissions. Tying people down to that level of development means condemning millions to premature death every year.</span><span xml:space="preserve"> </span><span>It is not true that pollution in the modern sense increases with growth. Instead, pollution follows an inverted U-curve. When growth in a very poor country gathers speed and the chimneys begin belching smoke, the environment suffers. But when prosperity has risen high enough, the environmental indicators show an improvement instead: emissions are reduced</span><span>, and air and water show progressively lower concentrations of pollutants. The cities with the worst problems are not Stockholm, New York, and Zürich, but rather Beijing, Mexico City, and New Delhi. In addition to the factors already mentioned, this is also due to the economic structure changing from raw-material-intensive to knowledge-intensive production. In a modern economy, heavy, dirty industry is to a great extent superseded by service enterprises. Banks, consulting firms, and information technology corporations do not have the same environmental impact as old factories. According to one survey of available environmental data, the turning point generally comes before a country's per capita GDP has reached $8,000. At $10,000, the researchers found a positive connection between increased growth and better air and water quality. 23 That is roughly the level of prosperity of Argentina, South Korea, or Slovenia. In the United States, per capita GDP is about $36,300. Here as well, the environment has consistently improved since the 1970s, quite contrary to the picture one gets from the media. In the 1970s there was constant reference to smog in American cities, and rightly so: the air was judged to be unhealthy for 100–300 days a year. Today it is unhealthy for fewer than 10 days a year, with the exception of Los Angeles. There, the figure is roughly 80 days, but even that represents a 50 percent reduction in 10 years. 24 The same trend is noticeable in the rest of the affluent world—for example, in Tokyo, where, a few decades ago, doomsayers believed that oxygen masks would in the future have to be worn all around the city because of the bad air. Apart from its other positive effects on the developing countries, such as ameliorating hunger and sparing people the horror of watching their children die,</span><span xml:space="preserve"> </span><span>prosperity beyond a certain critical point can improve the environment. What is more, this turning point is now occurring progressively earlier in the developing countries, because they can learn from more affluent countries' mistakes and use their superior technology.   For example, air quality in the enormous cities of China, which are the most heavily polluted in the world, has steadied since the mid-1980s and in several cases has slowly improved. This improvement has coincided with uniquely rapid growth</span><span>. Some years</span><span xml:space="preserve"> ago, the Danish statistician and Greenpeace member Bjørn Lomborg, with about 10 of his students, compiled statistics and facts about the world's environmental problems. To his astonishment, he found that what he himself had regarded as self-evident, the steady deterioration of the global environment, did not agree at all with official empirical data. He found instead that air pollution is diminishing, refuse problems are diminishing, resources are not running out, more people are eating their fill, and people are living longer. Lomborg gathered publicly available data from as many fields as he could find and published them in the book The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World. The picture that emerges there is an important corrective to the general prophesies of doom that can so easily be imbibed from newspaper headlines. Lomborg shows that air pollution and </span><span>emissions have been declining in the developed world during recent decades</span><span>. Heavy metal emissions have been heavily reduced; nitrogen oxides have diminished by almost 30 percent and sulfur emissions by about 80 percent. Pollution and emission problems are still growing in the poor developing countries, but at every level of growth annual particle density has diminished by 2 percent in only 14 years. In the developed world, phosphorus emissions into the seas have declined drastically, and E. coli bacteria concentrations in coastal waters have plummeted, enabling closed swimming areas to reopen. Lomborg shows that,</span><span xml:space="preserve"> </span><span>instead of large-scale deforestation, the world's forest acreage increased from 40.24 million to 43.04 million square kilometers between 1950 and 1994</span><span>. He finds that there has never been any large-scale tree death caused by acid rain. The oft-quoted, but erroneous statement about 40,000 species going extinct every year is traced by Lomborg to its source—a 20-year-old estimate that has been circulating in environmentalist circles ever since. Lomborg thinks it is closer to 1,500 species a year, and possibly a bit more than that.</span><span xml:space="preserve"> </span><span>The documented cases of extinction during the past 400 years total just over a thousand species, of which about 95 percent are insects, bacteria, and viruses</span><span>. As for the problem of garbage, the next hundred years worth of Danish refuse could be accommodated in a 33-meter-deep pit with an area of three square kilometers, even without recycling. In addition, Lomborg illustrates how</span><span xml:space="preserve"> </span><span>increased prosperity and improved technology can solve the problems that lie ahead of us</span><span>. All the fresh water consumed in the world today could be produced by a single desalination plant, powered by solar cells and occupying 0.4 percent of the Sahara Desert.</span><span xml:space="preserve"> </span><span>It is a mistake, then, to believe that growth automatically ruins the environment. And claims that we would need this or that number of planets for the whole world to attain a Western standard of consumption—those “ecological footprint” calculations—are equally untruthful.</span><span xml:space="preserve"> Such a claim is usually made by environmentalists, and it is concerned, not so much with emissions and pollution, as with resources running out if everyone were to live as we do in the affluent world. Clearly, certain of the raw materials we use today, in presentday quantities, would not suffice for the whole world if everyone consumed the same things. But that information is just about as interesting as if a prosperous Stone Age man were to say that, if everyone attained his level of consumption, there would not be enough stone, salt, and furs to go around.</span><span xml:space="preserve"> </span><span>Raw material consumption is not static</span><span xml:space="preserve">. </span><span>With more and more people achieving a high level of prosperity, we start looking for ways of using other raw materials.</span><span xml:space="preserve"> </span><span xml:space="preserve">Humanity is constantly  improving technology so as to get at raw materials that were previously inaccessible, and we are attaining a level of prosperity that makes this possible. New innovations make it possible for old raw materials to be put to better use </span><span xml:space="preserve">and for garbage to be turned into new raw materials. A century and a half ago, oil was just something black and sticky that people preferred not to step in and definitely did not want to find beneath their land. But our interest in finding better energy sources led to methods being devised for using oil, and today it is one of our prime resources. Sand has never been all that exciting or precious, but today it is a vital raw material in the most powerful technology of our age, the computer. In the form of silicon—which makes up a quarter of the earth's crust— it is a key component in computer chips. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036">There is a simple market mechanism that averts shortages. If a certain raw material comes to be in short supply, its price goes up. This makes everyone more interested in economizing on that resource, in finding more of it, in reusing it, and in trying to find substitutes for it.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> The trend over the last few decades of falling raw material prices is clear. Metals have never been as cheap as they are today. Prices are falling, which suggests that demand does not exceed supply. In relation to wages, that is, in terms of how long we must work to earn the price of a raw material, natural resources today are half as expensive as they were 50 years ago and one-fifth as expensive as they were a hundred years ago. In 1900 the price of electricity was eight times higher, the price of coal seven times higher, and the price of oil five times higher than today. 25</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036">The risk of shortage is declining all the time, because new finds and more efficient use keep augmenting the available reserves. In a world where technology never stops developing, static calculations are uninteresting, and wrong.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> By simple mathematics, Lomborg establishes that if we have a raw material with a hundred years' use remaining, a 1 percent annual increase in demand, and a 2 percent increase in recycling and/or efficiency, that resource will never be exhausted. If shortages do occur, then with the right technology most substances can be recycled. One-third of the world's steel production, for example, is being reused already.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036">Technological advance can outstrip the depletion of resources</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. Not many years ago, everyone was convinced of the impossibility of the whole Chinese population having telephones, because that would require several hundred million telephone operators. But the supply of manpower did not run out; technology developed instead. Then it was declared that nationwide telephony for China was physically impossible because all the world's copper wouldn't suffice for installing heavy gauge telephone lines all over the country. Before that had time to become a problem, fiber optics and satellites began to supersede copper wire. The price of copper, a commodity that people believed would run out, has fallen continuously and is now only about a tenth of what it was 200 years ago. People in most ages have worried about important raw materials becoming exhausted. But on the few occasions when this has happened, it has generally affected isolated, poor places, not open, affluent ones. To claim that people in Africa, who are dying by the thousand every day from supremely real shortages, must not be allowed to become as prosperous as we in the West because we can find theoretical risks of shortages occurring is both stupid and unjust.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036">The environmental question will not resolve itself. Proper rules are needed</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">for the protection of water, soil, and air from destruction. Systems of</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036">emissions fees are needed to give polluters an interest in not damaging the environment for others. Many environmental issues also require international regulations and agreements, which confront us with entirely new challenges. Carbon dioxide emissions, for example, tend to increase rather than diminish when a country grows more affluent. When talking about the market and the environment, it is important to realize that efforts in this quarter will be facilitated by a freer, growing economy capable of using the best solutions, from both a natural and a human viewpoint. In order to meet those challenges, it is better to have resources and advanced science than not to have them</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. Very often, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">envir</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036">onmental improvements are due to the very capitalism so often blamed for the problems. The introduction of private property creates owners with long-term interests.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> Landowners must see to it that there is good soil or forest there tomorrow as well, because otherwise they will have no income later on, whether they continue using the land or intend to sell it. If the property is collective or government-owned, no one has any such long-term interest. On the contrary, everyone then has an interest in using up the resources quickly before someone else does. It was because they were common lands that the rain forests of the Amazon began to be rapidly exploited in the 1960s and 1970s and are still being rapidly exploited today. Only about a 10th of forests are recognized by the governments as privately owned, even though in practice Indians possess and inhabit large parts of them. It is the absence of definite fishing rights that causes (heavily subsidized) fishing fleets to try to vacuum the oceans of fish before someone else does.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036">No wonder, then, that the most large-scale destruction of environment in history has occurred in the communist dictatorships, where all ownership was collective. A few years ago, a satellite image was taken of the borders of the Sahara, where the desert was spreading. Everywhere, the land was parched yellow, after nomads had overexploited the common lands</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> and then moved on. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036">But in the midst of this desert environment could be seen a small patch of green. This proved to be an area of privately owned land where the owners of the farm prevented overexploitation</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">and engaged in cattle farming that was profitable in the long term. 26 Trade and freight are sometimes criticized for destroying the environment, but the problem can be rectified with more efficient transport and purification techniques, as well as emissions fees to make the cost of pollution visible through pricing. The biggest environmental problems are associated with production and consumption, and there trade can make a positive contribution, even aside from the general effect it has on growth.</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000036">Trade leads to a country's resources being used as efficiently as possible. Goods are produced in the places where production entails least expense and least wear and tear on the environment</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. That is why the amount of raw materials needed to make a given product keeps diminishing as productive efficiency improves. With modern production processes, 97 percent less metal is needed for a soft drink can than 30 years ago, partly because of the use of lighter aluminum. A car today contains only half as much metal as a car of 30 years ago. Therefore, it is better for production to take place where the technology exists, instead of each country trying to have production of its own, with all the consumption of resources that would entail. It is more environmentally friendly for a cold northern country to import meat from temperate countries than to waste resources on concentrated feed and the construction and heating of cattle pens for the purpose of native meat production.</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-000001"> </span></p><h4 dir="ltr" class="pt-Heading4"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">Cap solves environmental destruction</span></h4><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000010">Veer 12 </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000084"><br />&#x200e;</span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Pierre-Guy, Independent journalist writing for the Von Mises Institute, 5/2, “Cheer for the Environment, Cheer for Capitalism,” http://www.mises.ca/posts/blog/cheer-for-the-environment-cheer-for-capitalism/</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">No Ownership, No Responsibility </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">How can such a negligence have happened?</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> It’s simple: </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">no one was the legitimate owner of the resources</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> (water, air, ground). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">When a property is state-owned</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> – as was the case under communism – </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">government has generally little incentive to sustainably exploit it</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">In communist Europe</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">governments wanted to industrialize their country in order</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">, they hoped, </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">to catch up with capitalist economies</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">Objectives were set, and they had to be met no matter what.

Our findings here at the IMF—that carbon pricing is practical, raises revenue that permits tax reductions in other areas, and is often in countries’ own interests—should strike a chord at the United Nations Climate Summit in New York next week. Let me explain how. Ever since the 1992 Earth Summit, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-underline">policymakers have struggled to agree on an international regime for controlling emissions, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">but with limited success. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-underline">Presently, only around 12 percent of global emissions are covered by pricing programs, such as taxes on the carbon content of fossil fuels or permit trading programs that put a price on emissions. Reducing CO2 emissions is widely seen as a classic “free-rider” problem. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">Why should an individual country suffer the cost of cutting its emissions when the benefits largely accrue to other countries and, given the long life of emissions and the gradual adjustment of the climate system, future generations? </span><span class="pt-underline">This argument crucially ignores immediate domestic environmental benefits from reducing CO2</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. Fossil fuel combustion, especially coal, is a leading cause of local outdoor air pollution which, according to World Health Organization figures, is estimated to cause over 3 million premature deaths a year worldwide—through increasing the risk of heart disease, lung cancer, and so on. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-IntenseEmphasis">Taxing the carbon </span><span class="pt-StyleUnderline">content of coal will increase its price, and decrease its use, leading to both fewer CO2 emissions and better public health due to cleaner air. A carbon tax would also increase motor fuel prices, which will reduce traffic congestion and accidents as people economize a bit on their use of vehicles</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">.

I have just argued the historical case. Consider two contemporary examples of lifesaving and life improving medical advances. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">The development of anti-retroviral drugs to combat AIDS has been incredibly expensive</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">, although today the drugs themselves are not expensive to make and they are being distributed in many developing countries for very low prices.

Another biomedical advance that promises to save or improve the health of many premature infants is the development of the actifier</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">. Premature infants often have trouble learning to suckle, a task that requires a great deal of coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing muscles. The actificr is a simple, cheap device that provides instant feedback to the infant that teaches it to suckle properly, often in just a few sessions. Learning this coordination of muscles is the first step that infants need to take to bootstrap cognitive skills necessary for a successful and rich human life. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">It </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">also </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">allows infants to breastfeed</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">, which is especially crucial in places where water quality is questionable and assaults against a child's immune system are likely to be many. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000013">This device will no doubt save many lives at low cost in developing countries.

The Apollo moon program certainly didn’t create labor and other resources out of thin air. On the contrary, the scientists, unskilled workers, steel, fuel, computers, etc. that went into NASA in the 1960s were all diverted from other industries and potential uses. The</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000086"> government spent billions of dollars putting Neil Armstrong on the moon, and consequently the American taxpayers had billions fewer dollars to spend on other goods and services. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">This is just another example of what Frédéric Bastiat described in his famous essay, "That Which Is Seen, and That Which Is Not Seen." Whenever the government creates some public work, everyone can see the obvious benefits. For example, everyone can appreciate the fact that we put a US flag on the moon, and listened as Neil Armstrong apparently flubbed his memorized line. Or to use a more mundane example, everyone can see a beautiful new sports stadium financed (in part) by tax dollars. What people can’t see are the thousands of other goods and services that now won’t be enjoyed, because the scarce resources necessary for their production were devoted to the government project. Politicians may break moral laws, but they can’t evade economic ones: If they send a man to the moon (or build a new stadium), consumers necessarily must curtail their enjoyments of other goods. Thus the question becomes: Was the Apollo program (or new stadium) sufficiently valued by consumers to outweigh its opportunity cost (i.e., the value consumers place on the goods that now cannot be produced)? At first glance, this seems to be a difficult question to answer. After all, how can we possibly compare the benefits of the Apollo program with, say, the benefits of the additional shoes, diapers, automobiles, research on cancer, etc. that could have been alternatively produced? The short answer is, we can’t. This is just a specific example of the more general principle elaborated by Ludwig von Mises: the impossibility of economic calculation under socialism. Even if a central planning board were truly benevolent, and even if it had access to all of the technical conditions (such as resource supplies and technological recipes) of the economy, the planners would be at a loss to deploy the scarce resources in an efficient way. There would be no way to determine whether the chosen output goals were good ones, or whether an alternative plan could have provided the subjects with a better outcome. The above analysis might puzzle the reader. Yes, it is certainly difficult in practice to tell whether the Apollo program (or any other government project) is worth its cost, but isn’t that true of any undertaking? Why should this be a unique drawback for government endeavors?</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000086">The crucial difference is that private projects are subject to the profit and loss test. The owner of a private firm must pay market prices for all of his or her scarce resources</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">If the consumers do not then voluntarily spend enough money on the final product or service to recoup these expenditures, this is the market’s signal that the resources are more urgently needed in other lines (according to the consumers). </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000086">It can never be the case that all entrepreneurs find a particular resource "too expensive" to use; if no entrepreneurs were buying it, then the price of this resource would fall until some did</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">. </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">For example, it would be unprofitable—"wasteful"—to use gold in the construction of bridges; the extra money motorists would pay to drive across a golden bridge would not cover the additional expense. Yet it is profitable to use gold in the construction of necklaces or rings. Consumers are willing to pay enough for golden necklaces (versus silver or copper ones) that it makes it worthwhile for jewelers to buy gold for this purpose. Hence, the high price of gold is (among other things) a signal to engineers not to use gold in building bridges, because consumers would rather the scarce metal be used in jewelry. The principle is the same when it comes to space travel. The reason private entrepreneurs would never have financed the moon program in the 1960s is that the financial returns from such a project wouldn’t come close to covering the expenses. Yet this is just the market’s way to tell these entrepreneurs that the computers, scientists’ labor, fuel, etc. would be better devoted to other ends. By seizing tax dollars and financing the Apollo program, President Kennedy et al. simply forced Americans to forgo the thousands of products that, according to their own spending decisions, they would have preferred to the space adventures. Is this perspective crude materialism? Surely, there are all sorts of things that are not profitable in the narrow sense, and yet are of tremendous importance to humanity. Consequently, are we not in need of noble politicians acting in the public interest? Well, consider the $10 million dollar X Prize. This was a gift designed to promote space exploration. The same is true of Bigelow’s $50 million prize. The private sector’s promotion of abstract knowledge (as opposed to practical, marketable discoveries) is nowhere better demonstrated than in the Clay Mathematics Institute’s million dollar awards for the solution to any of seven important problems. Historically, there were many rich patrons of the arts and science; didn’t the Vatican pay Michelangelo not only to create beautiful art but also to increase donations? Indeed, it is a common misconception that in the free market, "the highest bidder" determines things. No, in a free market, the owner determines the use of a piece of property. When a man lets his teenage son take the car for the night, is he renting it to the highest bidder? Of course not. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000086">A system of property rights, and the freely floating prices that accompany the exchange of these rights, is necessary to ensure the best possible use of resources. This is true in something as mundane as car production, or something as exotic as trips to Mars. The private sector can finance safe and efficient space exploration</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000012">, </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">but it will only do so in projects where the benefits (including donations from enthusiasts) truly outweigh the costs. The success of SpaceShipOne illustrates these facts. Now that the public has seen the potential of private space flight, perhaps it will become politically possible to axe NASA and return its budget to the private sector.  </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000080"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">Exploration solves extinction </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000005"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000004">Oberg,  99’ </span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal"><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000006">(James, Space Writer and former Space Flight Engineer, Space Power Theory, http://www.jamesoberg.com/books/spt/new-CHAPTERSw_figs.pdf)</span></p><p dir="ltr" class="pt-Normal-000095"><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007">We have the great gift of yet another period when our nation is not threatened; and our world is free from opposing coalitions with great global capabilities. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">We can use this period to take</span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000007"> our nation and our fellow men into </span><span xml:space="preserve" class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">the greatest adventure that our species has ever embarked upon.

He compares humans to the planets that roam the night sky, as he says that humans will too wander through space. We will wander space because we possess a compulsion to explore, and space provides a truly infinite prospect of new directions to explore. Sagan’s vision is part science and part emotion. He hoped that the exploration of space would unify humankind. We propose that mankind follow the United States and our allies into this new sea, set with jeweled stars. </span><span class="pt-DefaultParagraphFont-000011">If we lead, we can be both strong and caring.
